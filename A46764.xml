            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>PART of the following Papers were written before Dr. <hi>Sherlock</hi>'s Book was publiſhed, without any deſign of Printing them: But I was much more confirmed in my Opinion, when all that the Dr. had ſaid was very far from giving me any Satisfaction. And as I was engaged in this Subject before, ſo I have kept cloſe to it, not concerning my ſelf with any thing elſe that the Dr. has ſaid in his Book: And I have been ſo far from Prejudice and Partiality, that I muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, before I had fully conſidered it, I could not but think much the better of Dr. <hi>Sherlock</hi>'s Notion becauſe it is his; and I am not ſenſible that I have been wanting in any reſpect, which is due to the Dr's Learning and Worth.</p>
            <p>And this is all that needed to have been ſaid by way of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face, if a Weekly Retailer of Politicks and falſe Hiſtory, after a very certain and poſitive Account, out of Manuſcript (as he told us) and Original Papers, given by him of that Convocation; the Acts and Canons whereof gave occaſion to the preſent Controverſy, had not at laſt produced Letter pretended to have been written by King <hi>James I.</hi> to a Member of the Convocation; which contradicts what I have ſaid in relation to it, and which ſome perhaps may give Credit to, if it be not ſhewn that it deſerves none.</p>
            <p>But this Letter is a Contradiction to all that he had ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of the Convocation, and ſerves only to expoſe the Vanity of this Pretender to ſecret Hiſtory. For before he informed us from his <hi>MSS.</hi> that the King was not inclined to favour the <hi>Dutch,</hi> but the Clergy were for it; and in this Letter the King is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to eſpouſe their Cauſe, but the Clergy are under mighty
<pb facs="tcp:95153:3"/>Scruples about it. This <hi>Obſervator</hi> is wont to leave his other Rarities with his Bookſeller to be viewed and examined; but we are only told that he had this Letter no body knows from whom, and that it was written no body knows when, nor to whom: It is to <hi>Good Dr. Abbot,</hi> but who this Dr. <hi>Abbot</hi> was is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain, and he tells us it has no Date, tho in his Contents he ſets it down as written in the year <hi>1604.</hi> What! had he forgot himſelf? or was he not yet reſolved, whether he ſhould date it or not? <hi>A Letter of King</hi> James <hi>to Archbiſhop</hi> Abbot <hi>concerning the Convocation, 1604.</hi> How comes he to be here ſo poſitive, that it was written to Archbiſhop <hi>Abbot,</hi> when he afterwards con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes it is only his Conjecture? But the Convocation was in <hi>1604.</hi> True, for it began in <hi>1603.</hi> and was continued by Adjournments and Prorogations till <hi>1610.</hi> But Biſhop <hi>Overall</hi>'s Convocation-Book bears Date only from <hi>1606.</hi> But it was written partly by a Secretary, as he imagines, and partly by the King himſelf; by ſome <hi>Scotch</hi> Secretary, I ſuppoſe; but King <hi>James</hi>'s hand is too well known, to truſt <hi>the Learned World</hi> (in his Cant) with a ſight of it, for fear of ſome Diſcovery.</p>
            <p>In this Letter King <hi>James</hi> blames the Convocation for aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that all Kings, if they be but in Poſſeſſion, are inveſted with Gods Authority; and then he ſays, <hi>But you know all of you, as I think, that the Reaſon of calling you together was to give your Judgment, how far a Chriſtian and a Proteſtant King may concur to aſſiſt his Neighbours to ſhake off their Obedience to their own Sovereign, upon the account of Oppreſſion, Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, or what elſe you like to name it. In the late Queens time this Kingdom was very free in aſſiſting the</hi> Hollanders <hi>both with Arms and Advice; and none of your Coat ever told me that any ſcrupled about it in her Reign. Upon my coming to</hi> England <hi>you may know, that it came from ſome of your ſelves to raiſe Scruples about this matter. And albeit I have often told my mind concerning</hi> Jus Regium in ſubditos, <hi>as in</hi> May <hi>laſt in the Star-Chamber upon the occaſion of</hi> Hale's <hi>Pamphlet; yet I never took any notice of theſe Scruples, till the Affairs of</hi> Spain; Holland <hi>forced me to it; all my Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours call on me to concur in the Treaty between</hi> Holland
<pb facs="tcp:95153:3"/>
               <hi>and</hi> Spain; <hi>and the Honour of the Nation will not ſuffer the Hollanders to be abandoned, eſpecially after ſo much Money and Men ſpent in their Quarrel. Therefore I was of the mind to call my Clergy together, to ſatisfie not ſo much me, as the World about us, of the Juſtneſs of my owning the</hi> Hollanders <hi>at this time: This I needed not have done, and you have forced me to ſay, I wiſh I had not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here we are told that the Clergy at the beginning of King <hi>James I.</hi> his Reign <hi>1603.</hi> were poſſeſſed with ſtrange Scruples, which they had never had before, concerning the <hi>Dutch</hi> Affairs; tho the ſame ſcrupulous Clergy at the ſame time maintained, that bare Poſſeſſion gives a Title to <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpers in any Government: and from the year <hi>1581.</hi> the united Provinces by virtue of expreſs Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges and Proviſions in that behalf had renounced all Obedience to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and had been treated with as free Eſtates by the neighbouring Princes. Now tho Scruples are ſometimes ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry unaccountable things, yet theſe are ſuch Scruples as I think have been ſeldom heard of, that Poſſeſſion ſhould give a Right, and yet not give the <hi>Dutch</hi> a Right, who had ſo many other Pleas beſides from expreſs Laws in their favour. But only ſome of the Clergy were ſcrupulous: <hi>Some!</hi> Who were theſe <hi>Some?</hi> They muſt be of the moſt conſiderable and eminent, and their Number muſt be conſiderable too; or elſe the King had taken no notice of it, at leaſt, he had never called a Convocation to decide the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie. But the Convocation was called <hi>to ſatisfie not ſo much the King</hi> nor the Clergy, <hi>as the World about us of the Juſtneſs of his owning the</hi> Hollanders <hi>at this time,</hi> that is, about Two or Three and Twenty years after the World had <hi>owned</hi> them, and when <hi>all the King's Neighbours called on him to concur in the Treaty between</hi> Holland <hi>and</hi> Spain; the Convocation is aſſembled to determine that for the Satisfaction of the World, which the World had been ſatisfied in ſo long before, and now called upon the King for his Concurrence in that very thing, about which all this Scruple was raiſed.</p>
            <p>But becauſe all men are fallible, and may change their minds, we know, ſometimes on the ſudden; let us examin how this Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter agrees with the Hiſtory of that time. How did King <hi>James</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:95153:4"/>help the <hi>Hollanders</hi> to ſhake off the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Yoak? Or what Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion could there be of Scruple in the Clergy at the beginning of his Reign, the they had neither held that Poſſeſſion gives a Right, nor that the <hi>Dutch</hi> had any better Claim? The King at his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Crown refuſed to concern himſelf in the War between <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> and would by no means be perſuaded to ſend the States any aſſiſtance of Forces,

               </note> but all that went into thoſe Wars, went only by his Permiſſion and Connivance, not by his Command; and all the Supply of Mony that I can find he furniſhed them with, was only thus; that after the ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Sollicitation and Importunity not only of the States themſelves, but of the King of <hi>France</hi> in their behalf, he conſented that a third part of the Money, which the <hi>French</hi> lent them, ſhould be upon the King of <hi>England</hi>'s account, ſo as to diſcharge a Debt, which was then owing to <hi>England</hi> from <hi>France;</hi> and ſoon after he gave inſtructions concerning what Money was due to <hi>England</hi> from the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Provinces.

               </note> obſerves, he could not but ſee how much it was for his Intereſt, that the War ſhould continue; for by this means <hi>Spain</hi> was diverted, and taken off from giving him any diſturbance in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> or in any other part of his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions.</p>

            <p> In the year <hi>1607.</hi> the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Provinces were treated with as Free Eſtates both by the Arch-Dukes, <hi>Albertus</hi> and <hi>Iſabella,</hi> and by the King of <hi>Spain</hi> himſelf. The Arch-Dukes declare,

               </note> 
               <hi>that they are content to treat with the General Eſtates of the United Provinces in quality, and holding them for free Countries, Provinces and States, whereunto they pretend not any Title.</hi> And the King of <hi>Spain</hi> in his Ratification ſays, that <hi>he upon due deliberation and advice of his own certain know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, and abſolute Kingly Power and Authority— had made unto the ſaid Eſtates, and by theſe preſents did make the like Declaration, which the Arch-Dukes had formerly made, as much as in him lay, and that he declared himſelf to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, that in his name and in his behalf, the ſaid Eſtates ſhould be treated withal in quality, and as holding them at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent for free Countries, Provinces and Eſtates, to whom he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended no Title at all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This was at the firſt entrance upon a Treaty in Order either to a Peace or a Truce, and afterwards I think, there could be no cauſe of Scruple, tho the King had never ſo openly and vigorouſly eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pouſed their Intereſt at the Treaty; as he did indeed the year fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing appear with more Zeal and Reſolution in their behalf, than before he had done. But what happened not till <hi>1608.</hi> could not oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion the Scruples mentioned in the Letter to have been in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of his Reign, and the laſt Book of the Convocation had paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Lower Houſe April <hi>16. 1606.</hi> as it bears date.</p>
            <p>What Scruple then could the Clergy raiſe to themſelves in this Caſe? Did K. <hi>James</hi> by his ſtanding Neuter, or by his League with <hi>Spain</hi> engage himſelf in the War with the <hi>Dutch</hi> againſt <hi>Spain?</hi> or could the moſt Scrupulous men think it unlawful for him to promote the Peace as a Friend and Allie to both Nations? or rather muſt we not contradict all the Hiſtories of that time, if we will believe this to be a true Letter?</p>
            <p>We know by our <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Conſtitutions and Canons,</hi> that the Convocation had other Buſineſs before them, than the Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the <hi>Dutch</hi> affairs; and few men are ſo little acquainted with the State of Affairs in <hi>England</hi> at the beginning of King

               <hi>James</hi> the firſt's Reign, but they know that there was too great occaſion (and I doubt there will always be) for the Clergy to declare and explain the Doctrin of the Church concerning the Authority of Kings, and the Allegiance of Subjects.</p>
            <p>The Books of <hi>Parſons,</hi> and <hi>Buchanan</hi> and ſeveral others had fill'd mens minds with ſuch Principles, as the Orthodox Clergy neither of that, nor of ſucceeding Reigns have been yet able to diſpel. The Kings Prerogative both in Spiritual and Temporal Affairs was the ſubject of the moſt and the Principal Books writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten at that time, as well as of the Convocation; and we always have had too great cauſe at home, to need to go ſo far as the <hi>Low-Countries</hi> for an occaſion to treat of Allegiance. But then more eſpecially when there was ſuch an <hi>attempt</hi> by Gunpowder, <hi>and</hi> fire <hi>from</hi> Hell <hi>to blow up and deſtroy their Sovereign, and the whole State of the Country</hi> &amp;c. as they mention. lib. <hi>2.</hi> can. <hi>1.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But indeed if there were nothing elſe to prove this Letter forg'd, what it contains about the Convocation would be a ſufficient Proof of it; for I think nothing can be more plain to an unprejudiced Reader, than that, in the Senſe of the Convocation, an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurper is then only <hi>Throughly Settled,</hi> when the People have ſubmitted to him, and when there is no other Prince, who has a better Claim.</p>

            <head>The TITLE of an USURPER after a <hi>Thorough Settlement</hi> examined, in Anſwer to Dr. <hi>SHERLOCK</hi>'s <hi>Caſe of the Allegiance due to Sovereign Powers,</hi> &amp;c.</head>
            <p>TO avoid all Ambiguity and Diſpute about Words, and to bring the Matter in debate to as narrow a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs as I can; I ſhall reduce it to this Queſtion:</p>
            <p>Whether the Thorough Settlement of an Uſurper doth entitle him to the Allegiance of the Subjects, over whom his Uſurpation is throughly ſetled, tho the Rightful King who is out of Poſſeſſion be ſtill living, and demand their Allegiance?</p>
            <p>The Reſolution of this Queſtion in our preſent Caſe depends firſt, upon the Authority of BP. <hi>Overall</hi>'s Convocation-Book; ſecondly, upon the Reaſon of the thing it ſelf.</p>
            <p>Firſt, the Convocation expreſly determins, that there is ſome kind of <hi>Thorough Settlement,</hi> which is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to give a Title, and whether it be the Thorough Settlement now deſcribed, is the Thing to be exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined. And for the better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the Senſe of the Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it will be convenient to give a brief Account of the firſt Book, ſo as to collect all together that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns this matter; that at one view a more clear and diſtinct Notion may be had of it.</p>
            <p>They declare their <hi>Chief Purpoſe to be to imitate the Scriptures in ſetting out,
<note place="margin">Ch. 1. Can. 1.</note> and deſcribing the Deity and Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of our Saviour Chriſt, by his Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty Power and Univerſal Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all the World, as Heir of all things and Head of his Church.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ch. 2. Can. 2.</note> And therefore they firſt affirm, that he created the World, and gave the ſupreme Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to <hi>Adam for his time, and to the reſt of the Patriarchs and chief Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſucceſſively, before the Flood; or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining, by the very Law of Nature, that their Children and Off-Spring ſhould fear, reverence, honour and obey them.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ch. 6.

But <hi>Nimrod</hi> deſcended of <hi>Cham, not contenting himſelf with the Patriar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal or Regal mild Government,
<note place="margin">Ch. 8.

Whereupon, it is deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by the Convocation; <hi>If any one ſhall affirm, that the ſaid Poſterity
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:95153:6"/>of</hi> Noah's <hi>Children did well, in alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing either the Manner or Form of Civil Government which God had appointed; by bringing in of Tyranny or factious Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pularity — or that it was lawful for ſuch as then ſerved God, upon any Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence to have imitated their Examples: He doth greatly err.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Abraham</hi> with his Family being by God called out from among the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and idolatrous People of <hi>Chaldea,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ch. 8, 9, 10. Can. 10.</note> that Supremacy of Power, which he had over his own Family, was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued down to <hi>Jacob:</hi> And tho af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards this Authority was much weakened and diminiſhed, during the abode of the Chilldren of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in <hi>Egypt;</hi> yet in Proceſs of time, according to <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Prophecy, the Scepter was beſtowed on <hi>Judah.</hi> In the mean time, they were firſt go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by <hi>Moſes,</hi> and then by <hi>Joſhua</hi> after <hi>a mild and temperate manner.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ch. 11. Can. 11.</note> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Death of <hi>Joſhua,</hi> they had no conſtant Succeſſion of Princes, but God raiſed up Judges from time to time, as Occaſion required, to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and to govern them: But upon the Peoples impatience and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, God appointed <hi>Saul</hi> for their King; and laſtly the Scepter came to the Tribe of <hi>Judah</hi> by <hi>David</hi>'s ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement to the Throne,
<note place="margin">Ch. 14.

            </p>
            <p>But after the Kingdom was thus become Hereditary,
<note place="margin">Ch. 15. Can. 15.</note> the Kings were as much obliged, as ever, to the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of thoſe Laws, which God had preſcribed for them to govern by; and that they might do this the better, they had their Judges and Inferiour Magiſtrates; which was no diminution of their Power, but they <hi>thereby ordered their Kingdoms with ſuch a temperate and fatherly Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration; as was moſt agreeable for the Government of God's People.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then the Convocation ſhews by a brief recapitulation of the Particulars from the beginning of the World,
<note place="margin">Ch. 16. Can. 16.</note> that <hi>Kings</hi> by Gods inſtitution have a Paternal Authority, and that Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects ow them the Obedience of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to their Paren<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s.
<note place="margin">Ch. 17, 18, 19. Can. 17, 18, 19.</note> And whether the Kings or ſupreme Governours were nominated and appointed im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately by God himſelf, or ſuccee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by an Hereditary Right, as in the Kingdom of <hi>Judah,</hi> neither the Prieſts nor People had any ſhare in confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring upon them their Regal Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but this was immediately and ſole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from God. The following Chapters and Canons to the 23d. are ſpent in ſhewing and explaining the Authority of the Kings and ſupreme Governors among the <hi>Jews</hi> in Eccleſiaſtical Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs and the Subjection and Duty of the Prieſts to them, by which they were bound not to depoſe or riſe up againſt them upon any account what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever. And then by way of Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on againſt this Doctrin is brought the Example of <hi>Jehoiada</hi>'s depoſing <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaliah;</hi> In anſwer to which it is ſaid, that the Right of Succeſſion accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Gods own appointment was in <hi>Joaſh,</hi> and that therefore <hi>Athaliah,</hi> though ſhe had ſate ſix years on the Throne, might lawfully be depoſed, as being ſtill but an Uſurper, but that this ought not to be drawn into Example againſt a lawful King.</p>
            <p>To obviate another Objection they obſerve,
<note place="margin">Ch 25. Can. 25.</note> that the Prophets under the Old Teſtament did often ſeverely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke their Kings, and ſometimes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed one King before the deceaſe of another. Thus <hi>David</hi> was anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by <hi>Samuel,</hi> in <hi>Saul</hi>'s life-time, to ſucceed him; and <hi>Jehu</hi> was put into actual poſſeſſion of the Kingdom of
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:95153:6"/>
               <hi>Iſrael</hi> by <hi>Elizeus,</hi> and as God had commanded by the ſaid Prophet, <hi>he killed</hi> Joram <hi>before that time his Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign, but then his Subject.</hi> But theſe things were done by a direct and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Meſſage from God, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore were to be no Precedent to the <hi>Jews</hi> themſelves, (much leſs to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers) unleſs God ſent a Prophet with the ſame Order and Commiſſion.</p>
            <p>Another Objection is wont to be made againſt the Authority of Kings from <hi>Jer.</hi> 1.10.
<note place="margin">Ch. 26. Can. 26.</note> which is likewiſe anſwered.</p>
            <p>A fourth Objection might be rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed from the Example of <hi>Otheniel,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ch. 27. Can. 27.</note> and more eſpecially from the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of <hi>Ahud,</hi> who ſlew <hi>Eglon</hi> King of the <hi>Moabites,</hi> to whom the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> had been Eighteen years in Subjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: But theſe are ſhewn to be as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Caſes as that of <hi>Jehu</hi> was.</p>
            <p>But ſtill another Difficulty ariſes; for the Monarchical Government ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of hitherto among God's own People,
<note place="margin">Ch. 28. Can. 28.</note> was <hi>mild and temperate,</hi> but in other parts of the World, <hi>the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate and fatherly Government, which</hi> Noah <hi>had preſcribed unto his Off Spring, and which God himſelf eſtabliſhed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards amongſt his own People,</hi> was ſoon degenerated into Tyranny, as we ſee by what the Scripture relates of <hi>Nimrod;</hi> or into Republicks, as amongſt the <hi>Romans,</hi> who rebell'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their Kings, and quite caſt off Kingly Government; and in like manner ſeveral Forms of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment were introduced in ſeveral o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Nations. In this Caſe the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation determins; that tho it be ſinful in them, who by Invaſion or Rebellion invert the Order of the World, and ſet up <hi>degenerate Forms of Government</hi> inſtead of that <hi>temperate and fatherly Government,</hi> which God has ordained; yet when theſe Forms are thoroughly ſetled, as that Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Government of <hi>Nimrod</hi> and the Bepublick of the <hi>Romans</hi> in Proceſs of time were; they muſt then be ſubmitted to: For tho they were at firſt introduced by very wicked Practices, yet God having vouchſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed to eſtabliſh them, and to inveſt them with his own Authority, they muſt be obeyed as his Ordinance.</p>
            <p>Theſe things thus ſtated and clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the Convocation proceeds to the remaining courſe of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory,
<note place="margin">Ch. 29. Can. 29.</note> and ſhews that the <hi>Jews</hi> ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Allegiance to the Kings of <hi>Perſia</hi> after their return from <hi>Babylon,</hi> who ſtill <hi>continued by God's Appointment a ſupreme Authority over them:</hi> And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly <hi>Jaddus</hi> the High Prieſt, when <hi>Alexander</hi> required him to aſſiſt him in his Wars and become Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary to him, returned this Anſwer;
<note place="margin">Ch. 30. Can. 30.</note> 
               <hi>that he had taken an Oath for his true Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance to</hi> Darius, <hi>which he might not lawfully violate whilſt</hi> Darius <hi>liv'd. But when</hi> Alexander<hi>'s Authority was ſetled amongſt them,</hi> the Caſe was altered,
<note place="margin">Ch. 31. Can. 31.</note> and they then owed him the ſame Subjection, that before they had ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Darius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After <hi>Alexander</hi>'s Death the <hi>Jews</hi> became again a free People, he lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving behind him no Succeſſor;
<note place="margin">Ch. 31.</note> but they were miſerably oppreſſed by the bordering <hi>Kings</hi> of <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>Syria,</hi> eſpecially by <hi>Antiochus Epipha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,</hi> whoſe <hi>Invaſion and Government was moſt unjuſt and Tyrannical; until</hi> Mattathias <hi>moved with the monſtrous Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty and Tyranny of the ſaid</hi> Antiochus, <hi>made open Reſiſtance, the Government of that Tyrant being not then either gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally received by Submiſſion, or ſetled by Continuance.</hi> The great diſorders amongſt the Prieſts brought many and grievous Afflictions upon the <hi>Jews,</hi> both under the Government of the <hi>Grecians,</hi> and of the <hi>Maccabees;</hi> till at laſt <hi>Pompty</hi> took <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> by the Aſſiſtance of <hi>Hircanus,</hi> who had been diſplaced from the High Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
<note place="margin">Ch. 32, 33, 34. Can. 32, 33, 34.</note> his younger Brother <hi>Ariſtobu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> getting into his room: And tho <hi>Hircanus</hi> did very wickedly in taking this occaſion to revenge himſelf of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:95153:7"/>his Brother, by enſlaving his Country; yet when the <hi>Jews</hi> had ſubmitted to the <hi>Romans,</hi> and had yielded themſelves up to their Government, they were ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly inexcuſable in thoſe Rebellions which they afterwards raiſed, and which ended in their own Deſtruction.</p>
            <p>Having thus far ſpoken of that <hi>mild and moderate Form of Civil Government</hi> which God at firſt eſtabliſht through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the World,
<note place="margin">Ch. 35. Can. 35.</note> and afterwards pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved (in ſome meaſure) amongſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> till they by their perverſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Rebellions brought utter ruin upon themſelves; they ſay laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that Chriſt is the univerſal Lord and Governor of the whole Earth, and the orders of the ſeveral particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Kingdoms and Governments of it, as it may beſt conduce to the deſigns of his Wiſdom and Goodneſs in the Government of the whole World, which is but one univerſal Kingdom under him.</p>
            <p>The Subſtance then of what the Convocation ſays is this; Firſt, Chriſt as Creator and Governor of the World eſtabliſhed a <hi>mild and temperate and fatherly Government,</hi> which was to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue throughout all Ages in all Parts of the World, but the Wickedneſs of men ſoon introduced other <hi>degenerate Forms</hi> either Tyrannical or Popular, and theſe of ſeveral Sorts and Denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, <hi>Democratical, Ariſtocratical,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="2">2. God calling <hi>Abraham</hi> out of <hi>Chaldea</hi> into <hi>Canaan,</hi> and chooſing his Poſterity for his peculiar People, continued this <hi>mild and Paternal Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment</hi> amongſt them, and upon all Occaſions did himſelf appoint their chief Governors, till at laſt he ordained that the Government ſhould be Hereditary, and entailed it upon <hi>David</hi>'s Poſterity; ſo that the <hi>Jews</hi> were governed all along af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that original Form of Paternal Government, which God inſtituted at the firſt Creation of Mankind, and then again confirm'd after the Flood; though this Form of Government was much defaced and diminiſhed among the <hi>Jews</hi> in ſucceeding times, by the great Abuſes that crept in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them. And in this <hi>Government,</hi> Firſt, the Power was ſolely from God, not depending upon the conſent ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Prieſts or People, nor deriving any Authority from any Act of theirs. Secondly, their <hi>Kings</hi> had ſupreme Authority over all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and in all Cauſes as well Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical as Civil. Thirdly, their Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er was irreſiſtable, and they were accountable to God only for it. But againſt this ſeveral things might be objected from Examples among the <hi>Jews;</hi> which they anſwer by ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that in thoſe inſtances, God's particular Warrant and Commiſſion had been revealed, as in the Caſe of <hi>Ahud</hi> and <hi>Jehu;</hi> or that his Will and Command was fulfilled in their maintaining that Hereditary Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion which he had appointed, by depoſing an Uſurper, and ſetting up the Rightful Heir; and this was what <hi>Jehoiada</hi> did.</p>
            <p n="3">3. As for other <hi>degenerate</hi> ſorts of Government, though they ought not to have been introduced, yet when by never ſo ſinful Arts and Practices, by Uſurpations from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, or by Factions and Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons at home, they had any where been throughly ſetled, as the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments of <hi>Babylon</hi> and <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>Rome</hi> were, they muſt be ſubmitted to; becauſe where the Original, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Government was <hi>extinct,</hi> the Authority thereby devolved upon the Poſſeſſors of the ſupreme Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in theſe <hi>degenerate Forms,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they were Tyrannical or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publican; becauſe the ſupreme Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of the World would not ſuffer ſo great a Part of Mankind to be without any rightful Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for ſo long a time, and yet ſo they muſt be, unleſs he either autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rize theſe <hi>degenerate Forms</hi> upon the Extinction of the Paternal Original Government, or reſtore it by an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruling Providence.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:95153:7"/> 4. When the <hi>Jews</hi> themſelves were, by God's Judgment upon them for their Sins, placed under ſuch <hi>degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate</hi> kinds of Government, they were to pay the ſame Submiſſion to thoſe Governors, that they did to their own Kings; they might not depart out of <hi>Egypt</hi> without <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s leave firſt obtained, unleſs God would have warranted them to do it by his expreſs Direction and Command; they muſt not ſubmit to <hi>Alexander,</hi> whilſt <hi>Darius</hi> lived; and no Oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the <hi>Romans</hi> was a ſufficient ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe for their rebelling againſt them.</p>
            <p>This being the Senſe of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation, it will not be difficult to underſtand, what they mean by a <hi>thorough Settlement.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Their Words are theſe:</p>
            <p>
               <q>And when,
<note place="margin">Ch. 28.</note> having attained their ungodly Deſires, (whether ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Kings by bringing any Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try into their Subjection, or diſloyal Subjects by their Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious riſing againſt their natural Sovereigns) they have eſtabliſhed any of the ſaid <hi>degenerate Forms</hi> of <hi>Government</hi> amongſt their Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; the Authority either ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly gotten, or wrung by Force from the True and Lawful Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor, being always God's Authority, (and therefore receiving no Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment by the Wickedneſs of thoſe that have it) is ever (when any ſuch Alterations are throughly ſetled) to be reverenced and obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe Words being an inference from the Particulars before related in this Chapter, we muſt judg of them from the occaſion and deſign of the whole Chapter, and from the particular inſtances alledged in it. Firſt, the deſign of the Chapter is to ſhew what Obedience is due to <hi>Kings</hi> or other ſupreme Magiſtrates, where that <hi>mild and temperate Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> which had been the Subject of the foregoing Chapters, was not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, but other Forms ſet up in its room. For, <hi>as the rebellious Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours of the People, declining from their Obedience, did in many Countries alter that temperate and fatherly Government which</hi> Noah <hi>had preſcribed unto his Off-ſpring, and which God himſelf eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed afterwards among his own Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: So did the ambitious and inſatia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Diſpoſitions of ſundry no leſs elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where impeach the ſame, as by the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning and Progreſs of the Four Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchies it is moſt apparent.</hi> And therefore they now declare, what is to be thought of all theſe <hi>Aberrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from the ſaid mild and temperate Government before ſpecified:</hi> And they determine, That <hi>Almighty God, (who for the ſins of any Nation or Country al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereth their Governments and Governors, transferreth, ſetteth up, and beſloweth Kingdoms as it ſeemeth beſt to his Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Wiſdom)</hi> having in his Wiſdom ſuffered wicked men to introduce and eſtabliſh theſe <hi>new Forms,</hi> we are to look upon them as his Ordinance, and therefore to pay them all that Obedience which is due to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Government of his own Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution. Secondly, we may learn what is meant by a <hi>Thorough Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> from the particular inſtances here mentioned; and theſe are the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> Monarchy, the <hi>Roman</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, the Kingdom of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and all the Four Monarchies: When therefore any <hi>degenerate Forms</hi> of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, or <hi>Aberrations from the mild and temperate Government before ſpecified,</hi> are ſo ſetled, as theſe were, we muſt in Conſcience yield all O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to them, and not think that they have no ſufficient Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, becauſe they deviate from the firſt Pattern of Government preſcribed by God himſelf, and preſerved a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt his own People.</p>

            <p> It is indeed ſaid, that <hi>the Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty unjuſtly gotten, or wrung by force from the true and lawful Poſſeſſor, is God's Authority and therefore receives no Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment from the wickedneſs of thoſe that have it.</hi> Which ſeems to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that <hi>the true and Lawful Poſſeſſor</hi> may be ſtill living, and may ſtill claim the Allegiance of his Subjects, and that the Invader or Uſurper keeps Poſſeſſion <hi>as wickedly,</hi> that is, as much againſt all Human Law and Right as the firſt got into it: But if we obſerve the inſtances immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly added, it will appear that no ſuch thing can be concluded from this Paſſage. For they inſtance in the <hi>Kings</hi> of <hi>Egypt,</hi> who oppreſſed the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> after <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s Death, and in the <hi>Kings</hi> of <hi>Babylon,</hi> when they had brought the <hi>Jews</hi> into Subjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and had carried away the whole Nation into Captivity: But the <hi>Kings</hi> of <hi>Egypt</hi> after <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s Death had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly as good a Right as they had before it, and the <hi>Kings</hi> of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon</hi> had ſuch a Right to the Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance of the <hi>Jews</hi> as no other Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces could pretend to, when the whole <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Nation were brought under Subjection to them, and their <hi>Kings</hi> themſelves had made a Covenant with them, and taken an Oath to them, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 17.16. and were ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly commanded by God himſelf to ſerve the King of <hi>Babylon, Jer.</hi> 27. Yet theſe are the only Inſtances brought to ſhew that <hi>God's Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty receiveth no impeachment by the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs of thoſe that have it,</hi> that is, as no wicked means in the acquiring of Power can hinder, but that after a long and uninterrupted continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance (as in the Four Monarchies) theſe <hi>Forms</hi> of Government are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by God's Authority, ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can the abuſe of this Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, by Oppreſſion and Tyranny, when any ſuch Alterations are throughly ſetled, invalidate the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority itſelf, but it is <hi>always God</hi>'s <hi>Authority,</hi> and is ſtill to be reveren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, and obeyed as ſuch. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all the Severities and intolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Burthens which the <hi>Jews</hi> endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in <hi>Egypt</hi> and in <hi>Babylon,</hi> could not warrant their taking up Arms againſt thoſe <hi>Kings;</hi> ſo that the <hi>Jews</hi> themſelves, when brought under theſe <hi>new Forms</hi> of Government were obliged to ſubmit to them, and not by any Inſurrections or Violence en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to reſtore themſelves to that Primary Inſtitution of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which God had appointed, theſe having his Authority as much as that itſelf, when they are through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſetled, and when there is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Objection to be made to them, but that they are irregular and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt in their Conſtitution, or had an ill beginning, or are oppreſſive and Tyrannical in their Management and Adminiſtration: If all who had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Right or Intereſt in the former Government have ſubmitted to the new one, and are under the Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Engagements and Oaths to it, (which was the Caſe of the <hi>Jews</hi>) they muſt be obedient to it, howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver different from the former, or how much worſe ſoever it may be.</p>
            <p>But the Convocation acknowledge no other ſettlement,
<note place="margin">1.

For they juſtifie <hi>Matta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thias</hi> and his Sons in <hi>their open Reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,</hi> they made againſt <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes,</hi> becauſe <hi>his Government was neither generally received by Submiſſion, nor ſettled by continuance.</hi> Now <hi>Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi> was called in by a prevalent Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and had two years peaceable Poſſeſſion of <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> for ſo long it was, before <hi>Mattathias</hi> took up Arms againſt him, that <hi>Antiochus</hi> han en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> by the Treachery of that Faction, without any oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and it was three years longer, before it was recovered out of his Hands by <hi>Judas Maccabeus,</hi> ſo that he
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:95153:8"/>held it in all five years; yet becauſe that Faction only that invited him in had ſubmitted to him, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Party, who had the Right on their ſide, were not ſubdued nor brought to a Compliance by this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of his Government, it was not ſuch a Continuance as is required to that thorough Settlment, which the Convocation mention: But tho he had for ſo long time been in full Poſſeſſion of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and of their whole Country, and had, as the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation obſerve, ſpoiled the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and profaned it with his Idols, and exerciſed all the cruel and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Acts of the moſt abſolute and ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannical Conqueror, he had notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding no better Right ſtill, than at his firſt Uſurpation. So that the Convocation cannot mean a bare Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion, though it be never ſo full, by a <hi>Thorough Settlement,</hi> but ſuch a Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlem<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And that the meaning of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation could not be, that an Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per by being got into full Poſſeſſion, may have any Right or juſt Title a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the true Heir, appears from what they determine about the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing of <hi>Athaliab</hi> after ſix years Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion:
<note place="margin">Ch. 23.</note> For the Reaſon they give to juſtifie the Proceedings of <hi>Jehoiada</hi> therein is, that <hi>Joaſh their late King</hi>'s <hi>Son was then their only Natural Lord and Sovereign, although</hi> Athaliah <hi>kept him for ſix years from the Poſſeſſion of his Kingdom.</hi> It may here be object<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that this is a peculiar caſe, and that this Reaſon would hold good only in the Kingdom of <hi>Judah,</hi> where God himſelf had appointed and ſettled the Succeſſion of their <hi>Kings</hi> in the line of <hi>David,</hi> and that therefore <hi>Jehoia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da</hi> ſaid to the Congregation, <hi>Behold, the King's Son ſhall Reign, as the Lord hath ſaid of the Sons of David,</hi> 2. Chr. 23, 2. and the Convocation obſerves that he acquainted them, that <hi>it was the Lord's will that he ſhould reign over them,</hi> and that <hi>God himſelf had required all that they did at their Hands.</hi> For when God has given his Promiſe, we muſt interpret no oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currences of Providence, in contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction to in, and therefore we ſee that when the Kingdom was taken from <hi>David</hi>'s Poſterity, it was not done without an expreſs Revelation: But where God has made no Promiſe to a King and his Succeſſors that they ſhall enjoy the Kingdom, he may by his Providence take it away from them.</p>
            <p>To this I anſwer, That the whole deſign of the Convocation is, as I have ſhewn, to explain the Duty of Subjects by the example of God's own People, and therefore if in this place they ſuppoſe, ſomething ſo pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar in the Conſtitution of their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, that it could be no prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to other Kingdoms this muſt be a manifeſt contradiction to their whole deſign: They tell us that Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in its Original, and by its firſt Inſtitution was immediately from God, and was the ſame through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the World, and tho it were cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted in other Nations, God pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved it amongſt his own People; and yet ſtill the ſame Obedience was due under thoſe <hi>alterations from the ſaid mild and temperate Government,</hi> at firſt inſtituted, that was to be paid under this itſelf, and by conſequence there muſt be the ſame obligation to the Right Heir in all other Hereditary Monarchies; and therefore they call <hi>Joaſh</hi> here <hi>the true and natural apparent Heir to the Crown</hi> and <hi>their only natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Lord and Sovereign,</hi> which would be very unfit expreſſions, if they did not think, that he had an unalter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Right by the Law of Nature as well as by God's Promiſe. In was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough indeed that <hi>Jehoiada</hi> ſhould remind the People of God's own choice of <hi>Davids</hi> Poſterity to rule o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them, and nothing more needed
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:95153:9"/>to be ſaid by him; and it was very fit, that this ſhould not be omitted by the Convocation: But if this were the only Title which <hi>Joaſh</hi> had, it would have been improper to call him a Natural Heir, a <hi>Natural Lord and Sovereign,</hi> and it would have over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown all their Arguments from the P<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>ce of the Jews, if they had ſaid th<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap> 
               <hi>Joaſh</hi> ought to be plac'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Throne of his Anceſtors, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that ſix years interval, only by vertue of a Divine Promiſe: For a Divine command concerning any of their Kings or Judges for the time of their Lives, is equivalent to a Divine Promiſe concerning <hi>David</hi> and his Poſterity, and ſo it might be ſaid by parity of Reaſon, that the Duty which they owed their <hi>Kings</hi> was due by vertue of a revealed command from God, and could not be the ſame in other Nations, where there is no ſuch revealed Command. Thus <hi>David</hi> would not ſtretch forth his Hand a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Saul,</hi> for this Reaſon, becauſe he was <hi>the Lords anointed,</hi> that is, he was ſo choſen and appointed by God himſelf, as no <hi>King</hi> now can pretend to be: And ſo in all other inſtances, if we muſt argue from no example, where Gods command or promiſe intervenes, in vain does the Convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation explain the Duty of Subjects from the ſacred Hiſtory; and yet we muſt argue from no ſuch examples, if Gods revealed will alters the caſe, and makes it different from Caſes of the ſame Nature, which fall out in other Governments concerning which God has not revealed any thing.</p>
            <p>It is true indeed when God ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſes as to invert the ordinary courſe of Government, as in the caſe of <hi>Ahud</hi> and <hi>Jehu,</hi> this can be no Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent for any to imitate, without the ſame command to authoriſe them, that they had, but then it was no more a Precedent to the <hi>Jews</hi> themſelves, than to any other Nation. But when God only regulates the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Government according to the firſt inſtitution at the Creation, and ſettles it upon the Right of Succeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which is common to that with all other Hereditary Monarchies, and makes choice of the Perſon, to whom and to his Poſterity he grants a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Kingdom; or when he reforms abuſes, and puts things into their due courſe and order again, and enjoyns nothing but what with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Divine warrant, is of itſelf law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to be done, we may conclude that all theſe things are written for our inſtruction, and muſt be a Rule to all other Nations in the like Caſes.</p>
            <p>The Convocation therefore pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds all along upon this Principle,
<note place="margin">Ch. 2.6. Can. 2.6.</note> that from the firſt inſtitution of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment there is both a Natural and a Divine Right in all Sovereigns; which is Natural as it is founded on the Laws of Nature, and Divine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Government is Gods Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and owes its Original Form and Conſtitution to Gods own imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate appointment, and therefore that when God by his expreſs direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion and command afterwards ſettled that ſort of Government, which he at firſt inſtituted to all the World, among his own People, he did not thereby make any alteration in the Duty of Subjects, or Rights of Kings, but did only oblige both to perform their ſeveral Duties in that way and manner which he had enjoyn'd them. The Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> asked a <hi>King to judg them like all the Nations,</hi> 1 Sam. 8.5.20. And God choſe <hi>Saul</hi> to be their King, but what ever variations there might be in ſome cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtantials of Government, they owed juſt the ſame Duty and Subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to him, which was due to <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Noah,</hi> &amp;c. And according to the Convocation, every other Sovereign Prince has the very ſame Right that he had neither, they in asking, nor God in giving them a King made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny diſtinction between the Authority
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:95153:9"/>of their King and the Kings of other Nations; but the <hi>manner</hi> or Royal Power of their King is deſcribed to be juſt the ſame with that of the Kings round about them. God entailed the Kingdom of <hi>Judah</hi> upon <hi>David</hi> and his Seed, but the Right of Succeſſion was ſtill the ſame in that, which it is in all other Hereditary Kingdoms, only they had a Secondary Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the performance of their Duty from an immediate and poſitive Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, whereas others are oblig'd to the ſame Duties, but by Virtue only of the Law of Nature, and of the firſt Inſtitution of Government. The <hi>Jews</hi> then were bound to ſet up <hi>Joaſh</hi> in that Kingdom upon two accounts, that is, both as he was their Natural Sovereign, and as he deſcended from <hi>David,</hi> to whom God had made a peculiar Promiſe, and had given the Kingdom to him and to his Poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: but the firſt obligation had been of itſelf ſufficient, and thoſe Kings who hold by no Divine Promiſe, but only by Right of Inheritance, have the ſame Right which he had, who held by a Twofold Title, becauſe ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them had been alone ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent: For a ſingle Title is enough to convey a Right, and an Additional one can only confirm and ſtrengthen it.</p>
            <p>Indeed when there are two Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, one may ſometimes hold good, when the other fails: But then this muſt be, when the Titles are wholly diſtinct and independent one upon another, as they are not in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Caſe. For God beſtowed the Kingdom upon <hi>David</hi> for him and his Heirs after him to hold by Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, that is, to hold by the ſame Right that other Hereditary Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs hold by; ſo that if he by his Providence had diſpoſed of the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditary Right, and cauſed it to fail, his Promiſe which was grounded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Hereditary Right, or rather did ſuppoſe it, as its Object, or the Thing Promiſed, could now no long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er give him a Title to the Kingdom: For God by his Promiſe did not bar himſelf from diſpoſing of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Judah</hi> in the ſame manner, as he diſpoſeth of all other Heredita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Kingdoms, but he promiſed <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> that he ſhould Rule that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom by an Hereditary Right, juſt in the ſame manner and by the ſame Tenure from himſelf, that other He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditary Kings hold by. God had promiſed to protect the Kings of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah,</hi> and to continue the Kingdom to them, and that a peculiar Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence ſhould watch over them, but never that his Providence ſhould not have the ſame Power over them, that it had over all other Kings; and therefore we find that the Kingdom of <hi>Judah</hi> did not always continue without Interruption even in <hi>David</hi>'s Line, which yet it muſt have done, If God's Promiſe had been ſo to be underſtood, as that it was not to be ſubject to the Contingencies that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Hereditary Kingdoms are liable to. And upon this Account the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation propoſes the Kingdom of <hi>Judah</hi> as a Pattern to other King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, becauſe the Jews had God's Warrant and Direction in ſuch Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes as happen in other Kingdoms, whereas if their Proceedings were to be no example to others, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation had argued from a wrong Principle, and their whole firſt Book had been to very little purpoſe.</p>
            <p>But granting that the Kingdom of <hi>Judah</hi> was by the Entail upon <hi>Davids</hi> Line exempted from the ordinary Laws of Providence, yet I ſhall ſhew, Firſt, that it was not ſo exempted in the time of <hi>Joaſh.</hi> Secondly, that when God by his revealed Will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed the Kings of <hi>Judah,</hi> he ſo or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered it, that the Allegiance of the Subjects would have been transferred by human Laws and Juſtice, without a Revelation.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Tho the Kingdom of <hi>Judah</hi>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:95153:10"/>had been at firſt exempted from the common Laws of Providence, yet it could not be ſo exempted in the time of <hi>Joaſh.</hi> For the Promiſe to <hi>Davids</hi> Houſe was conditional, and upon ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, that his Children kept Gods <hi>Covenant and Teſtimony Pſ.</hi> 132.12. And when the Kings of <hi>Judah</hi> had by their Tranſgreſſions forfeited all that Right, which God had made over to them by Promiſe, they could no longer have any pretence to that exemption, but there is no Reaſon to think, but that his Poſterity might have fall'n from their Right by any way, which other Kings may. For the promiſe being conditional, if God by his Providence conveys away the Right to other Kingdoms, and inveſts all thoſe with his Authority, who are poſſeſſed of the Sovereign Power in other Nations, the <hi>Jews</hi> muſt have concluded in the Caſe of <hi>Joaſh</hi> and <hi>Athaliah,</hi> that ſince the Houſe of <hi>David</hi> had not performed the Conditions expreſly annexed to the Promiſe, God had taken the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiture of the Kingdom of <hi>Judah,</hi> and had by his Providence diſpoſed of it ſo as to ſet up another in the Room of the Right Heir. For a conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Promiſe can oblige no longer, than the Conditions are performed by them, to whom it is made, and therefore there could be no need of a new Revelation to take away the Kingdom from <hi>David's</hi> Line, ſince the Conditions upon which the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom was entailed, were notoriouſly violated by ſo many of the Kings of <hi>Judah,</hi> particularly by <hi>Solomon</hi> the firſt Succeſſor,
<note place="margin">1 Kings. 9.4, 5.</note> who, tho God had repeated to him the conditions of his Promiſe made to his Father <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> provoked God to that Degree that Ten Tribes were taken away from his Son, and Separated from the Kingdom of <hi>Judah;</hi> and by <hi>Aha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ziah</hi> the Father of <hi>Joaſh,</hi> who <hi>walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the way of the Houſe of</hi> Ahab.
<note place="margin">2 Kings. 8.27.</note> The Kings of <hi>Judah</hi> therefore not obſerving the Terms, which were enjoyned them at the making the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail, but tranſgreſſing that <hi>Covenant</hi> which God made with <hi>David,</hi> upon which the <hi>Throne of his Kingdom</hi> was <hi>eſtabliſhed,</hi> 2 Chron. 7.17, 18. God could be no longer bound to continue the entail in Performance of his Promiſe or Covenant, but that Kingdom muſt be afterwards in the ſame State, with all other King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, and there could be no Reaſon why God ſhould not diſpoſe of it, in the ſame manner, that he diſpoſes of any other.</p>
            <p>Secondly, When God by his revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Will depoſed the Kings of <hi>Judah</hi> he ſo ordered it, that the Allegiance of the Subjects would have been transferred by Human Law and Juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ice without any Revelation. For at laſt when the Scepter departed from <hi>David,</hi> tho not from <hi>Judah,</hi> tho the Kingdom was not taken from the Houſe of <hi>David</hi> but by Revelation, yet it was taken away in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as to make no breach upon the Rights of Kings over their Subjects, but to transfer their Allegiance accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the ways of Right and Juſtice amongſt men, for God had comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Kings of <hi>Judah</hi> to ſubmit themſelves to <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> and accordingly <hi>Jehoiakim became his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant three years.</hi> and afterwards when he came againſt the City, <hi>Jehoiakim went out</hi> to him, <hi>He and his Mother, and his Servants and his Princes, and his Offisers,</hi> 2 Kings, 24, 12. and ſubmitted to him in the moſt ſolemn manner imaginable, and therefore the Subjects Caſe was juſt the ſame, that it is, when there is no Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but only the Providence of God to transfer Allegiance: For if a King become Servant to the Conquerour, if he and his Servants, and his Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and his Officers, all that have Right or Authority in the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment are carried away Captive, and ſubmit and bind themſelves by Oaths
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:95153:10"/>to the Conquerour, as the Kings of <hi>Judah</hi> did <hi>Ezek.</hi> 17.16. there is no doubt but the Subjects may follow their Kings Example, and become Subjects to the Conquerour, as well as he, and cannot be obliged to reſerve their Allegiance to him, by vertue of that Right, which he has now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned: For when a King has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned his Crown, whether it be by God's Appointment, or upon ſome other Account, he has reſigned his Right to the Subjects Allegiance, and they are then at liberty to ſubmit to another Prince. And it is a good Evidence, that the Allegiance of Subjects is not transferr'd by Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence without the Reſignation or Death of the Rightful King, becauſe it was not otherwiſe transferred by Revelation.</p>
            <p>Obj. <hi>The</hi> Iſraelites <hi>had been</hi> 18 <hi>years in ſubjection to the</hi> Moabites, <hi>as they had been a little before</hi> 8 <hi>years to the</hi> Aramites, <hi>and they knew that it was not lawful for them of themſelves to take Arms againſt the Kings whoſe Subjects they were,
<note place="margin">Ch. 27.</note> tho indeed they were Tyrants: And therefore they cryed unto the Lord for Succour.</hi> Yet both theſe Nations could have no other Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority over them, but what was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by Conqueſt and a thorough Settlement.</p>
            <p>I anſwer firſt, the Scripture ſays, <hi>the Anger of the Lord was hot againſt</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and he ſold them into the hand of</hi> Chuſhan-riſhathaim. <hi>Judg.</hi> 3.8. <hi>and v.</hi> 12. <hi>The Children of</hi> Iſrael <hi>did evil again in the ſight of the Lord: and the Lord ſtrengthned</hi> Eglon <hi>the King of</hi> Moab <hi>againſt</hi> Iſrael. From whence it is probable, that God who governed the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> by a more than ordinary Providence, and made frequent Declarations of his Will to them, eſpecially in denouncing his <hi>Judgments,</hi> before any remarkable Puniſhment was inflicted upon the whole Nation, to give them time for Repentance; did now diſcover to them, that the <hi>Aramites</hi> and <hi>Moa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bites</hi> were ſent by him to ſubdue them. <hi>For the Anger of the Lord was hot againſt</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and he ſold them into the hand of</hi> Chuſhan-riſhathaim, <hi>and he ſtrengthened</hi> Egion <hi>the King of</hi> Moab <hi>againſt</hi> Iſrael: But if this Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment were not particularly foretold and denounced; yet this they knew in general, that <hi>theſe Nations the Lord left to prove</hi> Iſrael <hi>by them, to know whether they would hearken to the Commandments of the Lord, which he commanded their Fathers by the hand of</hi> Moſes v. 1. and 4. And therefore when they were vanquiſhed and were forced to ſeek their Preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by ſubjecting themſelves to their Enemies, they well knew that they had no Power nor Authority to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ſuch <hi>Kings,</hi> whom God for their ſins, as he had before threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, had ſet over them, but they cryed unto the Lord, and he raiſed up a Deliverer for them. Secondly, the whole Nation was in ſubjection 18 years to the <hi>Moabites</hi> and 8 years to the <hi>Aramites,</hi> and when they had once yielded themſelves up, and were become their Subjects, no Right which any other Perſon had over them being prejudiced thereby, they were obliged to keep their Oaths or other Engagements of Obedience to them, and were bound to pay all Duties of Allegiance to theſe <hi>Kings</hi> after they had owned them for their <hi>Kings,</hi> tho they were Tyrants, that is, tho they governed them in a rigorous and tyrannical manner. For the conſent of a Nation may be the means of conveying a Right to a Prince in ſuch a Caſe, where no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther has any precedent Right to their Allegiance, tho there be no expreſs Warrant from God for their ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: ſo that there being at this time <hi>no King in Iſrael,</hi> there was no inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry done to any man, if the whole Nation ſubmitted to the Conqueror.</p>

<note place="margin">Ch. 30.</note> 
               <hi>which he might not lawfully violate whilſt</hi> Darius <hi>li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</hi> And when <hi>Jaddus</hi> afterwards ſubmitted to him, it was by reaſon of a Command, which he had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by Revelation from God:
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Joſeph.</hi> Antiqu. l. 11. c. 8.</note> For as <hi>Joſephus</hi> relates, in the place refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to by the Convocation, <hi>Jaddus</hi> had appointed Publick Prayers and Sacrifices upon this account, and it was revealed to him in a Dream, That the People, in white, and the Prieſts and <hi>Jaddus</hi> himſelf, in their Holy Garments, ſhould go out to meet <hi>Alexander,</hi> and make their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to him, who no ſooner ſaw <hi>Jaddus,</hi> but he fell down and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped God, whoſe name he ſaw written on his Mitre; and when his Followers were all amazed at it, and <hi>Parmenio</hi> asked him the Reaſon of that ſtrange Action, he anſwered, that before his Expedition he ſaw in a Viſion one attired as <hi>Jaddus</hi> was, who encouraged him to undertake it, and promiſed him ſucceſs in it; and that it was not the Prieſt, but that God whom he ſerved, that he worſhipped. Secondly in Chap. 30. the Anſwer of <hi>Jaddus</hi> to <hi>Alexander,</hi> that he was bound by his Oath of Allegiance to <hi>Darius</hi> during his Life is mentioned and approved of by the Convocation, but neither in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Chapter nor Canon is any mention made of <hi>Jaddus,</hi> only it is ſaid in the Canon, <hi>that both Prieſts and People were the Subjects of</hi> Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander <hi>after his Authority was ſetled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, &amp;c.</hi> Which might be true, tho <hi>Jaddus</hi> had been faulty in ſubmitting to <hi>Alexander,</hi> whilſt <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> was alive. Thirdly, <hi>Jaddus</hi> went out to meet <hi>Alexander,</hi> and made his Submiſſion to him at his firſt Approach to <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> ſo that if his Example be to be followed, a City ought to ſurrender before it be beſieged, or ſo much as a Sword be drawn againſt it: And the firſt ſight and appearance of an Enemy is a different thing from that <hi>Thorough Settlement</hi> which the Convocation re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires, whatſoever we underſtand by it. The Convocation therefore could not propoſe the Example of <hi>Jaddus</hi> in all Circumſtances for our imitation: for either he had a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Warrant for what he did, or according to their Principle he muſt be highly blameable, becauſe he did not ſtay till there was a <hi>Thorough Settlement,</hi> nor indeed till there was any Settlement at all, before he ſubmitted to <hi>Alexander.</hi> But after the Death of <hi>Darius,</hi> his Authority was <hi>throughly ſetled;</hi> for <hi>Darius</hi> juſt before he expired ſent ſuch a Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage to him, with his thanks for his great Courteſie and Civility to his Mother and to his Wife and Children, as can amount to no leſs than a bequeathing to him his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and <hi>Alexander</hi> taking one of his Daughters in Marriage, no Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions were made afterwards a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his Right to the Kingdom of <hi>Perſia.</hi>

               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Firſt, The Deſign of the Convocation here is to ſet forth Chriſt's Univerſal Empire over all the World, and to ſhew that, <hi>for all their Dignity and Greatneſs, he did not leave Kings at liberty to do what they liſt, but held himſelf the Helm of every Government, and uſed their Services in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuch ſort, as, were they good or bad and their Deſignment holy or wicked, he ever made them the Executioners of his own juſt Judgments, will and good Pleaſure; according as he was minded either to bleſs on puniſh any Kingdom, People or Country.</hi> All which will be never the leſs true, tho God ſhould not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſe of Kingdoms merely by the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents and Succeſs of things, without any regard had to Humane Law and Rights.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The Chapters here quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by them are all concerning <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezzar.</hi> In the firſt, <hi>Jeremiah</hi> propheſieth of his Victories over the Neighbour-Kings, and commands them in Gods Name to ſubmit to him. And the two latter Chapters contain <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi>'s Dreams and <hi>Daniel</hi>'s Interpretation of them. In his ſecond Chapter <hi>Daniel</hi> tells him, <hi>Thou, O King, art a King of Kings, for the God of Heaven hath given thee a Kingdom, Power, and Strength, and Glory,</hi> v. 37. and then proceds to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, that by his Dream was ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the State of the four Monarchies. In the fourth Chapter of <hi>Daniel</hi> is related that Judgment which from God befel <hi>Nebuchadnezzar;</hi> and his Dream whereby it was foretold to him; <hi>The in ent of which was, that the living might know that the moſt high ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth in the Kingdom of Men, and giveth it to whomſoever he will, and ſetteth up over it the baſeſt of men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt then, as to the four Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies; we have here no intimation that God did raiſe up the firſt Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of them, or did approve of the <hi>Settlement</hi> they made: The <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> Monarchy, the Convocation takes notice of, began in <hi>Nimrod,</hi> contrary to Gods expreſs Inſtitution, he ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no Authority from God, as af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> had, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large his Dominions and make War againſt the bordering Princes. <hi>Cyrus</hi> we know indeed was Gods <hi>Anointed,</hi> and was Propheſied of by name long before his Birth, and alledg'd his Commiſſion and Charge from God in the Proclamation which he put forth in the firſt year of his Reign, 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 36.22.23. <hi>Ezr.</hi> 1.1, 2. God had declared of him, <hi>I have raiſed him up in Righteouſneſs, and I will direct all his ways,</hi> Iſai. 45.13. or as our Tranſlators have noted in the Margin, I <hi>will make ſtreight</hi> all his ways, and the Septuagint renders it, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. And <hi>Alexander,</hi> if we believe <hi>Joſephus,</hi> was encouraged by Revelation to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake his Expedition: But the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Empire had only Gods Permiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as far as we know, and at its riſe had no further Authority than the Juſtice of their Arms could give them: So that this Prediction is no Evidence, whether the firſt Erection and Settlement of theſe Monarchies were approved of by God or not;
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:95153:12"/>if they were erected by his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand and Appointment, or by a juſt Title, they were approved of by him; if by Injuſtice and Violence they were only made uſe of by him, as all other Wickedneſs is, to bring a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout by an over-ruling Providence his own juſt and righteous Decrees.</p>
            <p>Secondly, as to what concerns <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> himſelf; Firſt, all thoſe Expreſſions have an immediate rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to an extraordinary Caſe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in God had revealed his poſitive Will, commanding the ſeveral <hi>Kings</hi> mentioned by the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah</hi> to <hi>ſerve</hi> Nebuchadnezzar, <hi>and to put their Necks under his Yoak,</hi> and threatning them with the ſevereſt Puniſhments, If they would not do it, <hi>with the Sword, and with the Peſtilence, and with the Famine, untill he had conſumed them by</hi> Nebuchadnezzar<hi>'s Hand,</hi> Jer. 27, v. 8. and afterwards in the Book of <hi>Daniel,</hi> God takes away all his Power and Greatneſs to bring him to a ſenſe of his perpetual dependence upon God, and to an awe and reverence of the Divine Majeſty. Secondly, God had declared by his Prophet that he had given all the Neighbouring King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms <hi>into the hand of</hi> Nebuchadnez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar <hi>the King of</hi> Babylon <hi>his ſervant,</hi> and his Commands were in a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick and ſolemn manner given out, and ſent to all the Kings round about to charge'em that they ſhould without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Reſiſtance or Oppoſition reſign up themſelves and their Kingdoms in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to him. And this being ſome years before hand with ſuch Zeal and Earneſtneſs publickly and ſolemnly declared by <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> and ſo notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly known in all the adjacent Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> himſelf could not be ignorant of it; for which rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon he gave ſuch ſtrict Charge con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> that he ſhould be uſed with all manner of kindneſs and reſpect, <hi>Jer.</hi> 39.11. Afterwards <hi>Daniel</hi> in expounding his firſt Dream had plainly told him, that <hi>the God of Heaven had made him a King of Kings, and had given him a Kingdom, Power, and Strength, and Glory.</hi> Yet <hi>Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzar</hi> aſcribes all to himſelf, and therefore this Judgment was inflicted on him to make him ſenſible that all his boaſted Greatneſs was owing to God alone, who has abſolute Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity over the greateſt of Kings, and can advance to the height of Empire the <hi>baſeſt of Men; and thoſe that walk in Pride he is able to abaſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Beſides what relates perſonally to <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> there is a further in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention in the words, which reſpects all Princes in all Ages of the World. For <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> is ſet as an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of Gods Almighty Power, and of the frailty of all Human Greatneſs, to let the mighty Potentates of the Earth know, that all their Power is from God, and that he can deprive them of it, whenever he pleaſes.</p>
            <p>But Thirdly, This does not prove that God will give or take away the Power of other Princes, in the ſame extraordinary manner, that he both raiſed and debaſed <hi>Nebuchadnezzar.</hi> For as in ancient times there were-Prophets and Workers of Miracles, ſo theſe Prophets were ſometimes ſent by God himſelf to declare, in his name, that he had beſtowed King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms or Empires upon certain per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, as upon <hi>Nebuchadnezzar, Cyrus,</hi> &amp;c. And then theſe were no Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, becauſe they acted by Gods Appointment, and had a right pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent to any Conqueſt or <hi>Thorough Settlement.</hi> But there wrre in all A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges many Uſurpers too, and they had no Authority from God, nor were the People obliged to obey them, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no Command from him to do it. And as an Uſurper can have no Authority for his Uſurpations (for if he had they would be no Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pations nor he an Uſurper; ſo the continuance of his Uſurpations can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not make him theleſs an Uſurper, but the greater and the more injurious
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:95153:12"/>Uſurper. <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> was no U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurper from the beginning, becauſe he acted by Authority from God, and if concerning any Prince can be ſhewn ſuch a Commiſſion now, he is not an Uſurper but a Rightful King, and we muſt forthwith acknowledge his Authority, without ſtaying for a thorough ſetlement, but if he be at firſt an Uſurper, he muſt always be ſo, unleſs he acquires a Right by ſome other means, than a ſetled and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitual Injuſtice. The Scripture no where informs us that God authoriſes Uſurpers, after a <hi>thorough Settlement,</hi> but on the contrary that thoſe are no Uſurpers concerning whom God by his Prophets has given aſſurance to the People, that himſelf had raiſed them up to the Throne.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, All are now to be lookt upon as Uſurpers, who invade the Rights of their Neighbour Princes, for the ſame Reaſon that we eſteem all pretenders to Miracles and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecys no better than Cheats and Impoſtors. For <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> had Prophecys delivered coucerning him which entitled him to the Kingdoms he poſſeſſed: For tho he ſin'd in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vading the Dominions of other Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, if he did not believe the Prophet or knew not of his own Title granted him by God himſelf to them, yet he did them no injury, becauſe their Right was already transferred to him and therefore his Sin was only that of a Man, who robs another of that which is his own not knowing it to be ſo. But now Prophecys are ceaſed, as well as Miracles, and God acts by the ordinary courſe of his Providence as well as by the ordinary courſe of Nature. Miracles were neceſſary to awaken Mens attention, and put them upon a ſerious conſideration of Religion, and bring them to an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment of the Truth of it: and ſo were ſuch Revelations needful to manifeſt Gods infinite Power and Majeſty, and to make the greateſt Princes ſtand in awe of him; but when once theſe ends are ſerved, we are left to the Moral and Divine Laws of Reaſon and of Scripture for our Direction in the performance of our Duty, as we are to the Phyſical Laws of Nature in the Proviſions of Health and Life: and to conclude that every Conqueror has the ſame Right to our Obedience that <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> had to be obeyed by the Nations, whom he had ſubdued, is as groundleſs as to think that any man, who comes with lying Wonders and confident Stories, has a Power of Miracles and a Gift of Prophecys. God many times by a wonderful Providence caſts down Uſurpers, when they are moſt ſetled and ſecure in their unjuſt Poſſeſſions, and it is the Glory of his Infinite Wiſdom that when he ſuffers the World to go on in one conſtant Tenour, and does not interrupt wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men in heir enterpriſes and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices, yet the ſtill <hi>holds the Helm of Government,</hi> and the moſt laſting and ſetled Uſurpations cannot in the leaſt prejudice the execution and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of his juſt and Holy De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees: And in this he exerciſes his Dominion over Mankind, as he ſhews his Dominion over Nature by a ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and conſtant concourſe with natural Agents, notwithſtanding the many ſeeming Irregularities that appear in the World: and we ought no more to imagine his Authority in any Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers from whom we promiſe our ſelves Protection, then we may ſuppoſe a Miraculous Power in thoſe Charms, which ſometimes cure Diſeaſes.</p>
            <p>The Earth is the Lords and all that dwell in it, and it cannot be denied but God might if he had pleaſed, frequently raiſe up Princes as he did <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> but then he would ſend his Prophets to give notice of it: For we muſt conclude in this caſe, as the Convocation does in the caſe of <hi>Jehu,</hi> that it is unlawful to follow ſuch extraordinary examples, <hi>except
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:95153:13"/>firſt that it might plainly appear that there are now any ſuch Prophets ſent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarily from God himſelf,
<note place="margin">Can. 25.</note> with ſufficient and ſpecial Authority in that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half; and that we might be aſſured</hi> of every ſuch Prince as is by Uſurpati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſetled in anothers Dominions, <hi>that God himſelf had in expreſs words required and commanded</hi> us to ſubmit to him <hi>by Name;</hi> as he commanded the Nations whom <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered, <hi>to ſerve him,</hi> declaring that <hi>he had given all thoſe Lands into the Hand of</hi> Nebuchadnezzar <hi>the King of</hi> Babylon <hi>his Servant.</hi> Jer. 27, 6. But we may obſerve that as <hi>Nebuchadnez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar</hi> was raiſed up by God himſelf, ſo the Kings of thoſe Nations were commanded to ſubmit to him as well as their People, and did ſubmit, or were ſubdued by him, ſo that the Peoples part in that Revolution was no more than what Subjects may do now, if ſuch a thing ſhould be brought about by Providence; for when the King has ſubmitted himſelf, there is no Queſtion to be made, but that the Subjects may do ſo too.</p>
            <p>II. Having conſidered the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments from the Authority of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation, I now proceed to the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments from the Reaſon of the Thing itſelf.</p>
            <p>By an Uſurper in this Queſtion is plainly meant one who is in Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of the Kingdom contrary to the Laws and Conſtitution of the Realm, and without any Title but that of Poſſeſſion; and an Uſurper In Poſſeſſion is oppoſed to a Rightful King out of Poſſeſſion, whether he be either firſt, actually diſpoſſeſſed and driven out of his Kingdom; or ſecondly, have an undoubted Right to it, but has been always kept out of Poſſeſſion and could never come to the enjoyment of it. But it's grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that</p>
            <p>Firſt, If the Title be doubtful, the Subjects are at liberty to ſubmit to the Poſſeſſor, and ought not to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broil the Nation with Wars, and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice the Peace and Happineſs of it for an Uncertainty: And in this caſe the Subjects are oblig'd to ſtand by him, to whom they have ſworn Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance, till a clear Title be made out againſt him, upon defect where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the Oath was taken, upon ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that there was no precedent Obligation to another Prince, and therefore muſt oblige till it appears that his Competitor claims by an He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditary or other antecedent Right.</p>
            <p>Secondly, If in an Hereditary Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, after the thorough Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of an Uſurper, it ſhould ſo hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen that the Royal Line had failed, and the Right of Succeſſion were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct, the People might be oblig'd for their own, and for their Count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rey's ſake to ſubmit to the Uſurper and after their Submiſſion he would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come their lawful King. For tho he could have deriv'd no Authority from his <hi>Thorough Settlement,</hi> (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding there were none ſurviving of the Royal Line,) and the Subjects might have yielded themſelves up to the Obedience of any other Perſon, if they had had a convenient oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, ſo as to have done it without bringing damage and miſchief to the Publick by it, yet they might be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to ſubmit to him, to prevent that Slaughter and confuſion, which elſe would enſue, and if they ſhould have reſuſed to do it, they would have ſinned againſt God, in neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſafety of themſelves and of their Country, ſuppoſing neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs that no Injuſtice would have been done to the Uſurper thereby, and that he could have had no Right be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their Submiſſion.</p>
            <p>The Queſtion therefore is, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther an Uſurper who has no claim to the Crown but that of Poſſeſſion, tho he be never ſo long and throughly ſetled in the Throne, can have a Right to the Allegiance of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, whilſt their Rightful King, who
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:95153:13"/>has an Hereditary, or whatſoever o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther undoubted Title by the Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the Kingdom is alive, and requires them to bear Faith and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance to him?</p>
            <p>The Sum of what can be ſaid in the Affirmative ſeems to be this; That as it is ſhewn at large in the Convocation Book, <hi>Chriſt has reſerved the Government of the World and the diſpoſal of Kingdoms entirely to himſelf and can make or diſpoſe Kings, as he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, notwithſtanding any Claim, Right, Title or Intereſt, which they can chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge to their Kingdoms, and as he firſt ruled the world by frequent Revelations and Prophecies, ſo ſince theſe are ceaſed he doth it by his Providence only for he always retains the ſame immediate Inſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction with human affairs, but now ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſts his Pleaſure and gives out his Commands as Governor of the world by the Declarations of his Providence, that is, by the Succeſs and Event of things; for he could not govern the World as ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Lord and King of it, or which is all one, he could not require our Obedience in Compliance to his diſpoſal of Kingdoms if his Will were not ſome way or other diſcovered to us, and this being now the only way whereby he diſcovers it, we muſt acquieſce in the Events of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, ſo as to obey Chriſt the Supreme Governor of the world in the Perſon of him, whoſoever he be, whom he has ſet over us, making no enquiry into the Juſtice of the Cauſe, or into the means by which the Perſon now fully poſſeſſed of another Princes Power and Dominions, came ſo poſſeſſed of them. For God can take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way and transfer any Right or Title as he pleaſeth, and the Conduct of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence in a Thorough Settlement of the Government, is a ſufficient evidence that he has transferred it, becauſe it is the only evidence we now can have. And therefore we ought to look upon the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon thus ſetled, as inveſted with God's Authority, and to pay him a full and entire Allegiance, as his Vicegerent with the ſame Submiſſion, and upon the ſame Reaſons, as if he had commanded us to do it by an expreſs and immediate Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation; ſince his Providence is now the only Revelation, or Manifeſtation of his will, that we can expect, and it muſt be inſtead of all other Revelations to us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This ſeems to be the full of what can be fairly offered in the Affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and it is liable to the following Difficulties.</p>
            <p n="1">I. By Gods Providence muſt be underſtood either his Permiſſion in concurring with Natural Cauſes to produce their Effects; or his Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment.</p>
            <p>Firſt, If he only ſuffer or permit a thing to be done, without denying his Concourſe, or interpoſing his Almighty Power to prevent it, this by no means proves his Approbation of the Event or Succeſs of it. For he permits all the Wickedneſs, that is committed in the World, and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers the worſt men to proſper many times in their evil Courſes.</p>
            <p>Secondly, If by Gods Providence be meant his Appointment, this may ſignifie, Firſt, that he from all Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity decreed to permit the Event, and deſigned and ordained it to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance his own Glory, and to bring about ſome good to Mankind by it: And ſo the Treachery of <hi>Judas</hi> was appointed (Act. 2.23.) that is, God had decreed to ſuffer it to come to paſs, and had ordained it, when come to paſs, for the Salvation of Mankind. And there can be no doubt, but the final Iſſue, and ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate event of all the worſt Actions is ordained of God, and approved of by him; but the Caſe before us is of an intermediate and ſubordinate End, which muſt be judged of, whether it be good or bad, by the Nature of the thing, and not by any ſucceſs or event. That all will at laſt conclude in ſome good End in the long Series and Chain of Cauſes and Events, which are ordained by God's Decree is moſt certain, but then this doth
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:95153:14"/>not prove that the intermediate Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and Events are approved of by him, but we muſt enquire into the Juſtice of the Cauſe, whereby we can only know, whether the Event be pleaſing to him or not. Secondly, By Gods Providence as it ſignifies his Appointment may be meant his Will or Command: And this Will or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand is either for the doing of a thing, or for our Submiſſion and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſcence in it, after it is done. His command for the doing of a thing, cannot be known before the Event, but by the Juſtice of the Action, or by Revelation; to neither of which the Doctor pretends. And the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent cannot diſcover to us God's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to do a thing, which is already done and paſt, and I have in part ſhewn and ſhall more fully ſhew after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, that it can as little diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to us his Approbation of the thing done, or that it is his Will that we ſhould acquieſce and ſubmit to it.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Whereas it is ſaid, that, ſince God now governs the World only by his Providence, we muſt of Neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty acquieſce in the Event of things, or elſe we ſhould diſobey him in not ſubmitting to his diſpoſal of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments of the World. Firſt, God governs the World ſo as to require no Duty or Act of Obedience now of us, but what the Laws of Nature or of Scripture enjovn: And becauſe Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations are ceaſed, it ſeems requiſite, that he ſhould have revealed it in the Scriptures, if he had required us to acquieſce in the Events of things, and to look upon the moſt unjuſt Uſurper as inveſted with his own Authority, when he is once gotten into Poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Throne: I ſay this ſeems neceſſary to have been revealed, ſince Natural Reaſon cannot dictate it to us for in Gods permiſſion of all otherſort of Injuſtice in the World, we never i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine that any Right can accrue to the Injuring Perſon by it. Secondly, God by his Power and Wiſdom ſo orders things, as to make the moſt unjuſt actions ſubſervient to the Ends of Juſtice and Righteouſneſs, but not to reward Uſurpation with the Inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiture of his own Authority, or to turn wrong into right. And all that we learn from Scripture concerning God's Providence is, that we muſt rely upon it for Protection in the performance of our known Duty, and by conſequence that we are to regard the Juſtice only of a Cauſe, not the Succeſs of it.</p>
            <p n="3">III. This would make it unlawful for any Prince who is diſpoſſeſſed, or excluded from the Throne, to wage War againſt the Uſurper in defence of his own Right. For he is ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to have no longer any Right, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Uſurper is in full Poſſeſſion; becauſe that Right which God gives to the Uſurper, the Lawful King muſt be diveſted of, unleſs there can be two oppoſite Sovereign Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties at the ſame time, and both from God, who ſeverally retain the whole and entire Right at once to the ſame Kingdom. But we read that <hi>David</hi> waged War againſt <hi>Iſh-boſheth</hi> who was poſſeſſed of the Kingdom of all <hi>Iſrael</hi> for two years, and againſt the <hi>Jebuſites,</hi> who were in poſſeſſion of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and he was in continual Wars, before he was fully poſſeſſed of his Kingdom, for above ſeven years together. And there never was any diſpoſſeſt Prince, but he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to regain his Throne if he could, and never any Prince was blamed for it.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. This Argument would hold as well in private as in publick Affairs, ſince both are alike in God's diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal, and it would be as unjuſt for a man injuriouſly diſpoſſeſt of his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, to endeavour the recovery of it by due courſe of Law, as it would be for a King by waging War to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour the Recovery of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms For in both Caſes it may with equal Reaſon be ſaid, that the Title is
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:95153:14"/>loſt, and the Right transferred by God himſelf. And the Example of God's commanding the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to <hi>ſpoil the Aegyptians</hi> may ſeem as well to juſtifie the one Caſe, as his beſtowing Kingdoms in the Old Teſtament to juſtifie the other.</p>
            <p>If it be ſaid that there is a more pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar and extraordinary Providence, which rules and diſpoſes of Publick States and Kingdoms. Firſt, if by a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar and extraordinary Providence be meant, that God is wont more immediately ſo to interpoſe, as to change the ordinary courſe of Juſtice, and to transfer Rights, and diſplace, and diſpoſſeſs Rightful <hi>Kings</hi> more than he does Rightful Owners of private Eſtates, this ſeems to be groundleſs and diſagreeable to the Methods of his Juſtice and to thoſe Rules which the Scripture preſcribes to us, which are the ſame in our Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties towards <hi>Kings,</hi> as in thoſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards other men; and it beſides lays upon us greater Obligations to obſerve them: We muſt render to all their Dues, and particularly Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to whom Tribute is due, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Rom. 11.7. But we have no where the leaſt intimation, that the Rights of <hi>Kings</hi> ceaſe any other way than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Mens do, <hi>viz.</hi> by Death, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> not by a foreign In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſion, or the Rebellion of Subjects, or by the interpoſition of Providence in a concurrence of unfortunate Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents. And thoſe Texts which ſeem moſt to favour this ſuppoſition have been already conſidered, and if they prove any thing to this purpoſe, they muſt conclude as well concerning the Properties of Subjects, as concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Prerogatives of Princes, for it is as <hi>eaſie a thing with the Lord, to make a poor man rich,</hi> as it can be <hi>to ſet up over Kingdoms the baſeſt of Men.</hi> and the Providence of God is alike concerned in both Caſes; for as <hi>he leadeth Princes away ſpoiled, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throweth the mighty;</hi> ſo <hi>the Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of Robbers proſper, and they that provoke God are ſecure, into whoſe hand God bringeth abundantly,</hi> Job. 12.6.19. And thus we find <hi>Job</hi> aſcribes all his Loſſes and Calamities to Gods afflicting hand upon him; for God having all things in his Power and at his Command, is often ſaid to do what he does not hinder. Secondly, If by a peculiar and extraordinary Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence be meant ſuch a Care as is anſwerable to the great Importance of Publick Affairs and the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Kingdoms, this will imply no more than that Gods Care is more concerned and more imployed about things of greater importance, than in things of leſs moment, that is, it manifeſts itſelf in a greater number and variety of Exigencies, and is applyed to more Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Affairs: Yet, his Providence extends itſelf to the Hairs of our Heads, and to the falling of a Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row to the Ground, and is as watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful over the moſt inconſiderable and minute things in proportion to their Nature, as over the greateſt matters. His Providence, his Juſtice, and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is over all his Works, and he may as well be ſuppoſed to convey Private Eſtates to the unjuſt Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors of them, as to diſpoſe of King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms to Uſurpers; his Providence, which permits both, gives one no better Title than the other.</p>
            <p>Kings, 'tis true, receive their Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er from God and are his Vicegerents, and therefore are accountable to none but him, and can be depoſed by none elſe; but God inveſts them with his Authority, by the interven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſubordinate means, and by the Obſervation of the ſame Laws of Juſtice, which ought to be obſerved in the Rights and Poſſeſſions of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. Thus in the Elective Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies, there is the ſame Juſtice to be obſerved in the Election of the <hi>King,</hi> that there is to be obſerved in the Election of inferiour Magiſtrates,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:95153:15"/>tho, after Election, the <hi>King</hi> is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable to none but God, and the inferiour Magiſtrates are accountable to the <hi>King:</hi> And in an Hereditary Kingdom there is the ſame Right of Inheritance, (in reſpect of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Right or Juſtice) that there is in Private Eſtates, tho the Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance of Kingdoms be forfeitable to God only. For as God now makes no Kings by his expreſs Command and immediate Deſignation, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Methods of Law and Right amongſt men, ſo he depoſes and deveſts them of their Power in ſuch a manner as does not interfere with the ordinary courſe of juſtice, <hi>The Lord ſhall ſmite them, or their day ſhall come to die, or they ſhall deſcend into Battel and periſh,</hi> 1. Sam. 26.10.</p>
            <p n="5">V. Tho by the Law of Nations Foreign Princes may tranſact with any Conquerour as Rightful King: Yet by the Law of Nature Conqueſt can give no juſt Title, unleſs the Claim before Conqueſt were juſt; that is, indeed it gives no Title at all, but only recovers what before there was a juſt Title to. For even a juſt cauſe of War will not juſtifie a Conqueſt, unleſs there be a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent Right to the Dominions of the conquered Prince; as a Debt of 5 <hi>l.</hi> tho it will juſtifie a Suit at Law yet gives no Title to a mans whole Eſtate. And if <hi>a Thorough Settlement</hi> can give the Conquerour any Right, which he had not at firſt, it can be no leſs than ſuch a Settlement as the Laws and Cuſtoms of Nations allow, which is an undiſturbed and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conteſted Poſſeſſion for a term of years exceeding the Memory of man. <hi>Jeptha</hi> alledged againſt the King of the <hi>Ammonites</hi> the Preſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of 300 years, <hi>Judg.</hi> 11.26. and the time for Preſcription to King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms is generally ſet at 100 years: <hi>Duck de Uſu &amp; Authorit. Jur. Civil.</hi> l. 1. c. 1. S. 19. and yet the Civilians gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally maintain that the longeſt Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cription can give a right to none, but to thoſe who are <hi>Poſſeſſores bonae fidei;</hi> not to thoſe who came in by Fraud or Violence, but who thought they had a juſt Title, or knew of no better Claim. And if it ſhould be granted neceſſary for the Peace of the World, that ſome certain time be fixt, when, after a quiet and unmoleſted Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, all Pretenſions ſhould expire: Yet men muſt not be allowed to judg every thing ſetled that is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>permoſt, or that can brave it for a while, for this would in reality let no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing be ſetled, but would open a Gap to perpetual Diſturbances and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſions. For every thing that can be called a Government is ſetled or may appear to be ſo to Private Men, till it is overpowered. Thus, <hi>David</hi> fled from <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and went <hi>whither he might,</hi> uncertain whither to go, and almoſt deſpairing of his Return; <hi>Abſalom</hi> poſſeſſed himſelf of the City and <hi>David</hi> was ſo forlorn and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicable, that <hi>Shimei</hi> curſed him to his face, and threw ſtones at him, and told him withal, that Gods juſt Judgment was faln upon him in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge of the Blood which he had ſhed of the Houſe of <hi>Saul,</hi> and that <hi>the Lord had delivered the Kingdom into the hand of</hi> Abſalom <hi>his Son,</hi> 2. Sam. 16.8. And this ſeems to have been the general Opinion of all that followed <hi>Abſalom</hi> in his Rebellion; and therefore <hi>Huſhai</hi> choſe it as the faireſt Pretence to recommend him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to him, and make him believe that he was firm to his Intereſt; <hi>nay but whom the Lord and this People and all the men of</hi> Iſrael <hi>chuſe his will I be, and to him will I belong,</hi> v. 28. So that the Man after Gods own heart, and of his own deſignation to the Kingdom, could not be ſecure againſt this Principle; and it can hardly prove of better conſequence to other <hi>Kings,</hi> if they muſt be looked upon as abandoned and dethroned by God himſelf, whenever they are forced to withdraw, and by a ſtrong hand, are kept out of their Dominions
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:95153:15"/>And it ought to be conſidered, how King <hi>Charles</hi> II. could retain any Right to his Kingdoms upon this ſuppoſition; and yet he had an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſputable Right, during his long Abſence, in the Judgment not only of all the Loyal Nobility and Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy and Gentry of that time, but of our Parliaments and of the whole Nation ever ſince his Return.</p>
            <p n="6">VI We find in Scripture that when God himſelf does diſpoſſeſs <hi>Kings</hi> of their <hi>Kingdoms,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Dan.</hi> 4.26.2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 33.13.</note> he doth not always deveſt them of their Right but reſerves it for them, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtores them to the Poſſeſſion of it again upon their Repentance. Thus it was in the Caſe of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> and <hi>Manaſſes,</hi> and it is very reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to believe that God doth often puniſh <hi>Kings</hi> and Subjects too, by ſucceſsful Rebellions, and by Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pations upon the Regal Rights and Prerogatives, without any intention to releaſe them from the mutual Obligations of their reſpective Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to one another. And if this has been the Caſe as the Scripture in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms us it has; if Reaſon tells us, that ſuch Caſes may be again, ſince they are very agreeable to Gods Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, and Wiſdom, and Goodneſs in governing the World; then all that the Dr. hath ſaid for transfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Allegiance of Subjects, from the dispoſſeſſed King <hi>by Law</hi> to the Poſſeſſor of his Throne <hi>by Providence,</hi> falls to the ground.</p>
            <p>And yet we ought to be very ſure before we venture to act upon ſuch a Principle. For it would be a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Temptation and Encouragement to ambitious men, to be always ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king dangerous Attempts upon the Rights' and Dominions of Princes, if they could be aſſured, that if once their Uſurpation proved ſo proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous as to put them into a full Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion, they ſhould then be ſecured in it by a Divine Right, and would be ſo far from any Obligations to make Reſticution, that they would be bound to ſtand by it, and all the Subjects would be obliged to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and defend them with their Lives and Fortunes againſt the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſed Prince. It is not to be imagined what confuſion it would breed in the World, if no reſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on were to be made of what is got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by Fraud and Rapine out of Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Eſtates, but all were a Mans own that he could but get and keep. Men would eaſily flatter themſelves, that they might ſin firſt, and then repent at their leiſure; if this mortifying part of Repentance were but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted; but when they muſt reſtore all again or be damned, they may perhaps think fit to ſit down con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented at firſt. And this Doctrine would be ſo much the more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to Kingdoms, as they are great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Baits, and the Injuſtice is greater, and the Miſchiefs more grievous.</p>
            <p>But it may be ſaid, that tho this Argument from ſucceſs and a Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough Settlement ſhould not hold good in all Caſes, yet ſuch peculiar Circumſtances may ſometimes fall out, as plainly ſhew it to be God's doing, and command our Submiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Obedience. Suppoſe a Prince by a Series of fatal Miſcarriages, and by a ſtrong infatuation as it were from God upon all his Counſels, undermines his own Throne, and in a ſhort Reign loſes the Hearts of a Nation at firſt wholly devoted to his ſervice; ſuppoſe he alienates the affections of his greateſt Dependents and Favorites, and that the Body of his People revolt from him, and that all Orders and Degrees of men conſpire to renounce him, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out War or Bloodſhed ſet up ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in his room, in whom all their remaining hopes are placed, and whoſe Arms are attended by a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable and wonderful Providence; ſuppoſe that there is no Human Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the former King's return at all, and that if he do return it muſt be to the ruin of the Kingdom and
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:95153:16"/>the overthrow of the true Religion; is not this a Settlement ſo through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eſtabliſhed that we muſt needs be obliged to ſtand up in defence of it, and have we not in this caſe all the Aſſurance that can poſſibly be, without an expreſs Revelation that our Allegiance is transferred?</p>
            <p>This, I think, is the higheſt that the Caſe can be put. In anſwer to which, Firſt, It muſt be granted that all this cannot prove more ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually, that our Allegiance is trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred now it is brought about by his Providence, than if it had come to paſs by an expreſs Revelation, or than if God had denounced this as a Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon the Prince whom it is ſuppoſed to have befallen. For the utmoſt that can be ſuppoſed is, that Gods Providence is now the ſame Evidence of his Pleaſure to us, that his Revelation was to thoſe of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Ages; and therefore, if when God had declared that he did ſend ſuch Calamities as Judgments upon a Prince, this was no Argument to the People that they were releaſed from their Duty of Allegiance, it can be no Argument to us now, tho the Providence be never ſo ſignal and extraordinary. Secondly, We ſee in the Examples before-menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, that what befel thoſe Princes was from God, and that he had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſed them of their Kingdoms, and yet their Right ſtill remained. King <hi>David</hi> was forced to fly in great haſt from his own Palace, he left his Capital City and the Ark of God itſelf in the Enemies Power, and when <hi>Shimei</hi> curſed him, he made this Reflection upon it, that God had bid him to do it, and to make the Judgment ſtill more ſignal, <hi>Abſalom went in unto his Fathers Concubines in the ſight of all Iſrael,</hi> which was direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the fulfilling of that Judgment, which <hi>Nathan</hi> had popheſied, ſhould come upon him: yet his Subjects all the while could be excuſed from no Duty of Allegiance to him, but were as much obliged to all inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of it, as if he had been ſtill at <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi> and upon the Throne: tho <hi>Abſalom</hi>'s Followers interpreted it o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, as has been before obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and as for the Promiſe made to <hi>David,</hi> they imagined that it might have been as punctually fulfilled to his ſeed, tho himſelf had been ſet aſide, as if he had been actually dead, and probably they ſuppoſed that this was the Evil that God had threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; <hi>viz.</hi> to dethrone him, and ſet up his Son in his room; when he told him by his Prophet; <hi>Behold, I will raiſe up Evil againſt thee out of thine own Houſe,</hi> 2. Sam. 12.11. <hi>Manaſſes</hi> and <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> were as great Tyrants to their Subjects, as great Enemies to the true Religion, and as great Offenders in all reſpects againſt God as any Chriſtian King can be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be: Yet when God cauſed <hi>Manaſſes</hi> to be carried away captive to <hi>Babylon,</hi> and <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> to be driven from amongſt men to eat Graſs with the Beaſts of the Field; he brought theſe Afflictions upon them, not to deprive either of them of their Kingdoms, but only to hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble them, and then to reſtore them to their Thrones. And his dealing with <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> is moſt of all conſiderable in this matter, becauſe the Judgment upon him was purpoſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſigned <hi>to the intent that the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving may know that the moſt high ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth in the Kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomſoever he will, and ſetteth up over it the baſeſt of men,</hi> Dan. 4.17. and yet v. 26. it is told him, <hi>Thy Kingdom ſhall be ſure unto thee, after that thou ſhalt have known that the Heavens do rule:</hi> and in the 31. verſe. <hi>There fell a Voice from Heaven ſaying, O King</hi> Nebuchadnezzar, <hi>to thee it is ſpoken the Kingdom is departed from thee,</hi> which was taken from him for the ſpace of ſeven years, <hi>until he ſhould know that the moſt higheſt ruleth in the Kingdom of men, and giveth it to whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he will,</hi> v. 32. This then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:95153:16"/>an Example purpoſely ſet for the Admonition of Kings, and to acquaint the World that God raiſes them up, and depoſes them as he pleaſes; we may from hence conclude that tho they be diſpoſſeſſed by his Appointment whether ſecret or expreſs, yet we can have no certainty that he has utterly rejected them; but rather that upon their Repentance, he will again reſtore them to the Enjoyment of their Dominions, which they have ſtill a Right to, againſt any Uſurper or Poſſeſſour of them. Thirdly, What Danger ſoever Religion may ſeem to be in, yet it is manifeſt that throughout all Ages of the Church, Religion never flouriſhed more than in times of Perſecution; and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on itſelf forbidding us to defend it by any Diſloyalty, if by any ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſonable and unwarrantable means Subjects undertake the Preſervation of Religion, they may expect for their Reward no better than <hi>uzzah</hi>'s Fate, who put forth his hand to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the Ark of God, when he ſaw it ſhaking, and like to fall. God can preſerve it without our help againſt all the Power and Stratagems of the greateſt <hi>Kings,</hi> or he can turn the hearts of <hi>Kings,</hi> and of Enemies make them become its Defenders. So he turned the hearts of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> and <hi>Manaſſes,</hi> and there is no Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to ſuſpect, that God will not grant Princes ſpace for Repentance, now he rules the World by his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, as he did in thoſe Ages of Prophecy and Revelation.</p>
            <p>It may be alledged that where there is an expreſs Revelation, men muſt follow the directions God is pleaſed to give, and proceed no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than he appoints: But when we have only his Providence to guide us, we muſt not neglect to make uſe of the preſent occaſion, but muſt take all the opportunities, which Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence puts into our hands, as ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny indications of what God expects and requires of us.</p>
            <p>I anſwer, this is a plain Argument that we ought not to make God's Providence the Rule of our Actions, but his Law: Becauſe this principle would have miſled thoſe of ancient times, contrary to Gods deſign and purpoſe in an immediate Revelation, as well as it may now make us tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs his revealed Will recorded in Scripture, and his Laws ingraved in our Nature, I mean the Laws of Juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ice, and of Obedience to Governors. For from hence it appears that his Providence is not a ſufficient Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter of his Will, in what he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires of us; if it were they might have rely'd upon it then, and ſince it is not, we muſt not depend upon it now. Becauſe the Scripture is our Guide as much as an immediate Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation was theirs, and we have as little warrant to follow Providence, without a Revelation in Scripture for it, as they could have to follow it, without an immediate Revelation. For as Prophecys and Revelations are long ſince ceaſed, ſo we are no where told that God's Providence ſhall be inſtead of them to us, but the Scriptures are to us inſtead of all other Revelations, and we are to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret God's Will by his Providence no further than they direct us to do.</p>
            <p>And from the Scriptures we may be aſſured, that God by his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence often offers men opportunities of doing things, only for their Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, and when he gives them no licenſe to do them. If ever any circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of Providence could juſtifie an Action otherwiſe ſinful, they muſt have been thoſe, which <hi>David</hi> was in, when <hi>Saul</hi> was twice at his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy: He was before by Gods appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment anointed to ſucceed in the Throne, and <hi>Saul</hi> the firſt time came unexpectedly into his Power, the ſecond time a deep ſleep from the Lord was fain upon <hi>Saul</hi> and his whole Army; God had promiſed <hi>David</hi> to deliver his Enemy into his Hand, and <hi>David</hi>'s Followers both
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:95153:17"/>times did not fail to put him in mind of it: So that if Providence could be at any time a ſufficient warrant, <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> muſt have had as full a Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to have ſlain <hi>Saul,</hi> as <hi>Ahud</hi> had to kill <hi>Eglon,</hi> or <hi>John</hi> to kill <hi>Joram,</hi> and <hi>David</hi> muſt have concluded, that God who had before <hi>rejected Saul from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing King,</hi> had now actually deveſted him of all his Authority, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his Promiſe, had delivered <hi>Saul</hi> to him, to execute the divine Vengeance upon him: But becauſe this would have been to act againſt a known Duty, he ſtill owns <hi>Saul</hi> for his Maſter, and the Lords anointed, and repented of the cutting off but the Skirt of his Garment. All this probably was deſigned as a Tryal to <hi>David,</hi> as well as to propoſe him for an example of Fidelity to all Ages: and perhaps nothing can be more reaſonably concluded from our late Revolution, than that we are now cal'd to the practice of that Loyalty, which we have made ſuch high profeſſions of.</p>
            <p>I ſhall add no more, but only tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe ſome Paſſages out of Dr <hi>Sher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock</hi>'s <hi>Caſe of Reſiſtance</hi> to ſhew that the Authority of that very great Man can ſignifie little in this Controverſie, whatever his Arguments may do.</p>
            <q>
               <p>We know what uſe ſome men have made of this Argument of Providence to juſtifie all the Villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies they had a mind to act:
<note place="margin">p. 29.</note> But <hi>David</hi> it ſeems, did not think that an Opportunity of doing evil, gave him licenſe and Authority to do it. Opportunity we ſay, makes a Thief, and it makes a <hi>Rebel,</hi> and it makes a <hi>Murtherer:</hi> No men can do any Wickedneſs which he has no op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of doing, and if the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God which puts ſuch op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities into mens hands, juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies the wickedneſs they commit, no man can be chargeable with any guilt whatever he does; and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly opportunity will as ſoon juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie any other ſin, as Rebellion and the Murther of Princes. We are to learn our Duty from the Law of God, not from his Providence; at leaſt this muſt be a ſetled Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, that the Providence of God will never juſtifie any Action which his Law forbids.</p>
               <p>There is another Objection a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt what the Apoſtle affirms,
<note place="margin">p. 127.</note> that <hi>there is no Power but of God, the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers that be are ordained of God.</hi> For is the Power of Victorious Rebels and Uſurpers from God? Did <hi>Oliver Cromwel</hi> receive his Power from God? then it ſeems it was unlawful to reſiſt him too, or to conſpire a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him: Then all thoſe Loyal Subjects, who refuſed to ſubmit, when he had got the Power in his hand were Rebels and Traitors.</p>
               <p>To this I anſwer that the moſt proſperous Rebel is not the <hi>Higher Powers</hi> while our Natural Prince to whom we owe Obedience and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, is in being. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore though ſuch men may get the Power into their hands by God's Permiſſion, yet not by God's Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance; and he who reſiſts them does not reſiſt the Ordinance of God, but the Uſurpations of men. In <hi>Hereditary Kingdoms</hi> the <hi>King</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver dies, but the ſame Minute that the Natural Perſon of one King dies, the Crown deſcends upon the next of Blood; and therefore he, who rebelleth againſt the Father and murthers him, continues a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel in the Reign of the Son, which commences with his Fathers Death.</p>
               <p>It is otherwiſe indeed where none can pretend a greater Right to the Crown than the Uſurper, for there poſſeſſion of Power ſeems to give a right. Thus many of the Roman Emperors came to the Crown by very ill means, but when they were poſſeſt of it they were the <hi>Higher Powers;</hi> for the Crown did not deſcend by Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, for the poſſeſſion of Supreme and Sovereign Power is Title e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough where there is no better Title to oppoſe againſt it; <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p> But it was otherwiſe in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Judah,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>P.</hi> 131.</note> which God himſelf had intailed on <hi>David</hi>'s Family, as appears from the Example of <hi>Joaſh,</hi> who was concealed by his Aunt <hi>Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheba,</hi> and hid in the Houſe of the Lord for ſix years. During this time <hi>Athaliah</hi> Reigned, and had the whole power of Government in her hands; but yet this did not make her a Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign and irreſiſtable <hi>Prince,</hi> becauſe <hi>Joaſh,</hi> the Son of <hi>Ahaziah,</hi> the right Heir of the Crown, was yet alive. And therefore in the Seventh Year <hi>Jehoiada</hi> the Prieſt, ſet <hi>Joaſh</hi> upon the Throne, and ſlew <hi>Athaliah,</hi> and was guilty of no Treaſon or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion in doing ſo, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 11. Which ſhews, That no Uſurpations can extinguiſh the Right and Title of a Natural <hi>Prince.</hi> Such Uſurpers, though they have the poſſeſſion of the Supreme Power, yet they have no Right to it; and though God, for wiſe Reaſons, may ſometimes permit ſuch Uſurpations, yet while his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence ſecures the Perſons of ſuch depoſed and baniſhed Princes from Violence, he ſecures their Title too. As it was in <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi>'s Viſion, <hi>The Tree is cut down, but the ſtump of the Roots is left in the Earth.

            </q>
            <p>Hitherto I had written before Dr. <hi>Sherlock</hi>'s Book was publiſhed, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the moſt impartial conſideration of it, can now find no cauſe to change my Opinion; but having proceeded thus far, I ſhall, as exactly as I can, exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine all that relates to this matter in his Book, which I could not foreſee, and have not already given an account of.</p>
            <p>His Two firſt Sections, I cannot think my ſelf much concerned about, having already given both the full State of the Caſe, and the plain meaning of the Convocation. One thing indeed I omitted, which he remarks in the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Section: He obſerves, That whereas in the 30th Chapter, it is ſaid,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>P.</hi> 8.</note> That <hi>Jaddus</hi> returned Anſwer to <hi>Alexander,</hi> That <hi>he might not lawfully vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late his Oath of true Allegiance to</hi> Darius, <hi>whilſt</hi> Darius <hi>lived,</hi> the Convocation in the Canon following it, takes no notice that he owed Allegiance to <hi>Darius,</hi> during the Life of that King; <hi>And it is plain,</hi> ſays he, <hi>that</hi> Jaddus <hi>himſelf could mean no more by it, than that he could not make a voluntary Dedition to</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander; not that he never could ſubmit to him till <hi>Darius</hi> was dead; for <hi>when he was in</hi> Alexander<hi>'s power, he made no ſcruple to ſubmit to him.</hi> But I think it is not much material, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they mention this in the <hi>Canon</hi> or no, ſince they ſet it down in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Chapter, and then approve of the Behaviour and Conduct of <hi>Jaddus</hi> in the Canon. For if this part of <hi>Jad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus</hi>'s Anſwer, which was the moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable thing in it, had been diſliked by them, it muſt have been excepted; but when they give a general Approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of what <hi>Jaddus</hi> did, and except againſt no Particulars, they muſt be ſuppoſed to approve of it in all its Circumſtances before ſet down in the Chapter; at leaſt they muſt approve of that, which was the principal thing in <hi>Jaddus</hi>'s Anſwer: for when the thing that <hi>Alexander</hi> required of him was to <hi>bear Arms himſelf againſt</hi> Darius, <hi>or to ſolicite others thereunto;</hi> and <hi>Jad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus</hi> anſwered, That he might not do it, <hi>becauſe he had taken an Oath for his true Allegiance to</hi> Darius, <hi>which he might not lawfully violate whilst</hi> Darius <hi>lived:</hi> and the Convocation in their Canon deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, That if any man affirm, that <hi>having ſo ſworn</hi> he might have done it, <hi>he doth greatly err;</hi> they can mean no leſs in the Canon than they expreſſed in the Chapter, That <hi>he might not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully violate his Oath of true Allegiance to</hi> Darius, <hi>whilſt</hi> Darius <hi>lived.</hi> And
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:95153:18"/>the Doctor doth not deny, that they approved of theſe words in the ſenſe in which <hi>Jaddus</hi> meant them; and that <hi>Jaddus</hi> meant them in the ſtricteſt ſenſe, is evident; for the words will admit of no Latitude: and what <hi>Jad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus</hi> afterwards did, was by an imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Direction from Heaven; and therefore it can be no Argument, that <hi>Jaddus</hi> had any thoughts of ſubmitting to <hi>Alexander,</hi> whilſt <hi>Darius</hi> lived, when he ſent that Meſſage; but on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, That he was reſolved not to have ſubmitted, and ought not to have done it, unleſs a Revelation had war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted him to do it, and thereby ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved him from his Oath to <hi>Darius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In his Third Section, the Doctor lays down ſome Propoſitions, upon which his whole Diſcourſe depends; and indeed to grant him theſe Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, is to give up the Cauſe to him; for they plainly imply, and ſuppoſe the whole Queſtion, without any more to do.</p>
            <p>His Firſt Propoſition is, <hi>That all Civil Power and Authority is from God:</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>p.</hi> 10.</note> This he rightly obſerves, no man will deny him, but an <hi>Atheiſt.</hi> But then it ought to be proved, That it is ſo from God, as to exclude all Humane Rights and Titles; or that God now beſtows and conveys this Authority, contrary to the Rules of Law and Juſtice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Men, and in oppoſition to the Conſtitutions of particular Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and the Agreement and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the ſeveral Nations of the World. That God by his Providence doth ſet aſide all Humane Law and Right, and doth give an extraordinary and immediate Right and Title to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Uſurper, who is got into full Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of any Kingdom, becauſe <hi>no Man can have any Authority but from God,</hi> is no Conſequence, unleſs there be no other way for God to rule the World but in this manner: for if God may govern the World agreeably to the Methods of Right and Juſtice, which Reaſon obliges men to obſerve to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their Sovereign, and which by an Authority derived from God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and ſettled and enacted in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Countreys, then it cannot be known, but by Revelation, that God does ever interpoſe to the Prejudice of Legal Right, or abſolve Subjects from their Allegiance to their Natural Sovereign, by transferring his Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to an Uſurper.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Prop.</hi> 2. <hi>That Civil Power and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority is no otherwiſe from God, than as he gives his Power and Authority to ſome particular Perſon or Perſons to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern others.</hi> Civil Power and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity is from God in its Original Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, as well as in its Application and Donation to particular Perſons. But not to inſiſt upon that: The Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon or Perſons, who are inveſted with it, are either qualified for the Recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Authority from God, by a juſt Acceſſion to the Throne, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the particular Form or Conſtitution of the Government; or they muſt be appointed by Divine Revelation, which may diſcharge the Subjects from adhering to the Legal Conſtitution, in performance of their Allegiance ſworn to any other Perſon. But the Exerciſe of Power may be in him, who has properly no Authority, but only a Nominal one; that is, Men are forced to call it ſo, though it be really nothing leſs, for meer Force, and External Power, gives no Right, nor is any otherwiſe from God, than are the Natural Powers and Force of Wild Beaſts, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour Men, and other Creatures, not without the Permiſſion and Concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of God's Providence; and to uſe the Doctor's Expreſſion, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not devour a Man, <hi>whether God will or no.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="31" facs="tcp:95153:18"/>
            <p> 
               <hi>But if he Governs without receiving his Perſonal Authority from God, he Governs without God's Authority.</hi> No doubt, of it, he Governs, when he has no Right, and ought not to Govern: for the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of Authority may be uſurped, as well as the Enſigns of Authority, or the Jewels of the Crown; but the Right to Govern, which is beſtowed by God, is not always in him, who actually Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns, but in him, who ought to Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern, tho' perhaps he does not.</p>
            <p>Prop. 3. <hi>There are but three ways, whereby God gives this Power and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to any Perſons; either by Nature, or by an expreſs Nomination, or by the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſals of Providence.</hi> This may be granted, and yet the Diſpoſals of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence may be ſuch, as are agreeable to the Rules of humane Laws and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, and it remains to be proved, that there are any diſpoſals of Kingdoms by God's Providence contrary to theſe Rules. And whereas the Doctor ſays, that <hi>by what bounds the Paternal and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchal Authority was limitted, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell:</hi> I can ſee no Reaſon to make any ſcruple or enquiry concerning that matter, according to his Principles; for Men always had juſt as much Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, as they could by any means at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to the exerciſe of; if they could enlarge their Dominions, all they got by fraud, or violence, or by any way whatſoever of Injuſtice, was the gift of Providence; and if their Patriarchal Authority would not bear them out in it, yet the Divine Authority, which up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a full Poſſeſſion, they became in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted with, would never fail to give them an undoubted Right and Title. If they could by any means deprive their Subjects of all the Priviledges they enjoyed, and take from them all their Liberty and Property, and reduce them to the vileſt Slavery, they were by God himſelf ſettled in an Abſolute and Arbitrary Government. And by the ſame Argument the King of <hi>France</hi> has a Divine Right not only to the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipality of <hi>Orange,</hi> but to all the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpotick Power, which his Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries ſay he exerciſes over his own Subjects; ſince he is throughly ſettled in the Poſſeſſion of both.</p>
            <p>That <hi>God made Kings only in</hi> Jewry <hi>by a particular Nomination</hi> is a miſtake.
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 11.</note> For he nominated <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> and <hi>Cyrus</hi> as particularly, as he nominated <hi>David</hi> himſelf. Nor is it true, that God entailed no other Kingdom, but that of <hi>Judah;</hi> as the Doctor ſeems here to ſay. For as he entailed the Kingdom of <hi>Judah</hi> upon <hi>David</hi>'s Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity indefinitely, ſo he entailed the ſame Kingdom with many others upon <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> and his Son, and his Sons Son, <hi>Jer.</hi> 27.7. And God en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailed the Kingdom of <hi>Iſrael</hi> firſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Jeroboam</hi> and his Poſterity, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing him, that <hi>if he would keep his Statutes and Commandments, as David did, he would be with him, and build him a ſure houſe, as he built for David, and would give Iſrael unto him,</hi> 1 Kings 11.38. And afterwards he entailed it upon <hi>Jehu,</hi> and his <hi>Children of the fourth Generation,</hi> 2 Kings 10.30.</p>
            <p>There can be no doubt, but that <hi>God ruled in all the other Kingdoms of the World, as well as in Jewry, and all other Kings ruled by Gods Authority, as well as the Kings of Judah and Iſrael, who were advanced by his command.</hi> And therefore God ſometimes interpoſed his immediate Command, in the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of Kings in other Kingdoms as well as in thoſe of <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Iſrael;</hi> and he entailed other Kingdoms, and might do ſo now, if he pleaſed: but this is no argument, that he will do it, nor that we are now to expect it, ſince we are left to the guidance and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of his Providence in the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary courſe of things, and in our obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:95153:19"/>to the Laws of that Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Government under which we live, which are to determin when the Authority of Sovereigns ceaſes, and the Allegiance of Subjects; and we are not to think their Power and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority transferred, unleſs it be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred legally. For God now Rules the World by no expreſs Commands, or extraordinary Declarations of his Will, but Governs every People, by the juſt Laws and Conſtitutions of their Country: and whatever happens con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to theſe, he permits for good and wiſe Reaſons, known only to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. But Subjects are not to look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on themſelves, as diſcharged from their Duty and Oaths of Allegiance, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the Laws themſelves, and the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Conſtitution diſcharge them: for we are not at liberty to have recourſe to Providence for a Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Releaſe from the moſt Solemn Obligations that Nature and the Laws of the Land, and our own Oaths, and God himſelf by his Authority in his Vicegerents, by whom theſe Laws are enacted, laies upon us.</p>
            <p>But it is ſaid,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>g.</hi> 12.</note> That <hi>it makes no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference in this caſe to diſtinguiſh between what God permits, and what he does; for this diſtinction does not relate to the events of things, but to the wickedneſs of Men; which is the only reaſon for this Diſtinction; for the Scripture never ſpeaks of God's bare permiſſion of any e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents, but makes him the Author of all the good or evil, which happens either to private Perſons or publick Societies. The events of all things are in his Hands, and are ordered and diſpoſed by his Will and Counſel, as they muſt be, if God go verns the World: but God cannot be the Author of any wickedneſs, cannot inſpire Men with any wicked Counſels or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, nor incline their Wills to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of it; and therefore this we ſay, God only permits; but when it comes to Action, he over-rules their wicked De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns to accompliſh his own Counſels and Decrees, and either diſappoints what they intended, or gives ſucceſs to them, when he can ſerve the ends of his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence by their wickedneſs: and herein conſiſts the unſearchable Wiſdom of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, that God brings about his own Counſels by the free Miniſtries of Men: He permits Men to do wickedly, but all events, which are for the good or evil of private Men, or publick Societies, are or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by him, as the Prophet declares,</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mos 3.6. <hi>Shall there be evil in a City and the Lord hath not done it?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. I anſwer, There is no Reaſon, why we ſhould diſtinguiſh in this caſe between the Counſels and Deſigns of wicked Men; and their Actions in the execution of them; for God concurs, as much to the Phyſical Operations of the Mind in purpoſing and contriving Evil; as he does to the corporal acts in the bringing it to effect: for the Mind is as little capable of thinking as the Body is of moving without God's continual concourſe, both having a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary dependance upon him in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of their proper Faculties. And the Reſolution and Contrivance to do Evil, is the event or reſult of Thought and Conſideration, as the ſucceſs in the performance and accompliſhment of the Evil deſigned and reſolved up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is the event of the ſeveral outward Actions, which are done in order to it: ſo that God concerns himſelf no more in the events, which proceed from the exerciſe of the bodily Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in bringing about ill Deſigns, than in thoſe, which proceed from the Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of the Mind in the projects and contrivances of Evil: he permits both, and concurs with both, as they are the acts of Natural Cauſes, in the producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their effects, but as they have a tendency to Evil, he concurs with nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. He leaves Men a Liberty of
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:95153:19"/>Acting and Thinking, and concurs with them accordingly; he ſuffers them to ſin, and does not take from them the uſe of their Natural Faculties of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy or Mind, though they employ them to ill Purpoſes, and about wrong Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Evil,</hi> whether conſidered Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally, or Morally, that is, as it ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies Affliction, or as it ſignifies Sin; is in the <hi>Action</hi> as well as in the <hi>Event,</hi> and therefore the words of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Amos</hi> are applicable to both alike. For not only <hi>the Events of all things,</hi> but the <hi>Actions</hi> of all Creatures <hi>are in Gods hands; and are ordained and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by his Will and Counſel,</hi> and by the Doctors arguing, in all Actions, as well as in all Events, there is no diſtinction <hi>between what God permits, and what he does,</hi> which, he ſays, relates only to the wickedneſs of Men, and therefore it does not relate to the Actions of Men, but only to <hi>the wickedneſs</hi> of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Actions. For God <hi>gives ſucceſs,</hi> he ſays, to wicked Deſigns; when they come to <hi>Action</hi> he <hi>ſets up Kings, he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances them to the Throne, he gives them the Throne;</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 12, 13.</note> that is, he goes along with them, and aſſiſts them in the attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Supreme Power, and at laſt puts it into their hands. So that they have his concurrence, and aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, as much before the ſettlement, as after it, and he that at laſt gives them the Plenitude of Power, gave them all along the opportunity and the means of attaining it. For God makes no immediate Donation of it, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtows it upon them by his Providence, that is, by affording them ways and means to come by it. The plain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of which muſt be, that God not only ſuffers Men by wicked means to get into Power, and then beſtows his Authority upon them, but he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct; them in every ſtep they take, and at laſt when they arrive at the Throne, he places them in it. For what God gives by Providence, he does not give all at once, but by the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral degrees of ſucceſs, by which it is attained; and the ſucceſs of every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular action muſt be his Gift as much as the event it ſelf. And if every E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent be of Gods <hi>doing,</hi> every Action muſt be ſo too, becauſe Events pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from Actions, and are no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe done or brought about, than by the performance of thoſe Actions, which are requiſite to produce them; and to ſay that God is the Author of the Event, but not of the Action, is to ſay, that he is the Author of the Effect but not of the Cauſes Acting, whereas he cannot appoint the Effect without appointing the Cauſe to Act, unleſs the Effect could be produced without its Cauſe.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>End</hi> and <hi>Event</hi> are both but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative Terms, the end of one ſort or ſeries of Actions may be but the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of another, and the Event or Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of one Enterpriſe the Cauſe of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother. For that which is an Effect in reſpect of its Cauſe, is a Cauſe in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of its Effect; and that, which in reſpect of the means is the Event, is the means in reſpect of another Event. If then the Event of all things is from God, and therefore gives a Right; a Rebel or Uſurper would have a Right to every Fort or Caſtle he gets into his Poſſeſſion in order to his <hi>Thorough Settlement</hi> in the whole Kingdom, for that in its kind is as truly an Event as a <hi>Thorough Settlement</hi> it ſelf is in a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent kind: for he that poſſeſſes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of a Caſtle has gained his end as much for that time, and in that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular deſign, as he that is poſſeſſed of a Kingdom has gained his end, in the full accompliſhment of his deſires and deſigns. And when he has his wiſhes in this, perhaps he ſtops not here, but makes this End and Event only a ſtep
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:95153:20"/>to another Enterpriſe upon a Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour Kingdom, and then the obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the firſt Kingdom is but a means to gain the latter, as the ſeveral de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of ſucceſs were the means of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the firſt.</p>
            <p>But all other Events whatſoever are as means in Gods Hands, and are made uſe of by him, for the bringing about the final Events of things. God there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore does not approve of every Event ſo as to command us to acquieſs in it, any more than of every Means, but he approves, or diſallows of them, as they are either juſt, or unjuſt, good, or evil; and becauſe the laſt Events of things will be perfectly good, therefore they are approved of by him; and in the mean time he orders and diſpoſes all leſſer and precedent Events, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be good or evil, to the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment of theſe. The evil Events God neither approves in themſelves, nor gives any Right or Authority to the Perſons, whom he ſuffers <hi>to bring them about,</hi> but whilſt the Authors of them are diſliked and diſowned by him, he permits the Events for the ſake of that good, which he has decreed to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce out of them, and for that relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and ſubſerviency, which they have to the laſt Events of things, which he has determined and ordained from E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity.</p>
            <p n="4">4. If there be no difference between what God permits, and what he does, as to the Events of things, this will juſtifie all Events whatſoever, as being of God's doing; and therefore Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beries, and all the Wickedneſs in the World beſides, that is ſucceſsful, and ends in the deſired iſſue, muſt be aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to him: for theſe are as properly Events as any beſides can be; and the ſucceſs of things reſpect not their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but their End; and Actions at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain their End, not as they are of leſs, or greater moment, of publick or pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Concernment, but becauſe they anſwer the Deſigns of the men that perform them.</p>
            <p>And this will make it <hi>impoſſible,</hi> as the Doctor ſays expreſly, <hi>That there ſhould be any King, who is not Rightful with reſpect to God:</hi> which over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throws the Diſtinction he makes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Kingdom of <hi>Judah,</hi> and other Kingdoms. For <hi>Athaliah</hi> muſt have been as Rightful Queen as <hi>Joaſh</hi> was Rightful King, and both muſt have had God's Authority alike; and ſo the Subjects muſt have been obliged to Contradictions; that is, to aſſiſt <hi>Athaliah</hi> againſt <hi>Joaſh,</hi> and <hi>Joaſh</hi> againſt <hi>Athaliah,</hi> at the ſame time; becauſe ſhe had God's Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty by Providence, and he by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe; and therefore both muſt have been obeyed, and yet both reſiſted; and the Subjects muſt have owed Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance to both, and yet they muſt have owed Allegiance to neither of them. Thus it would have been likewiſe in the Caſe of <hi>David</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, to whom God firſt aſſigned the Kingdom of <hi>Judah;</hi> and <hi>Iſhboſheth,</hi> who was poſſeſt of the greateſt part of it for Two Years. For either <hi>Iſhboſheth</hi> and <hi>Athaliah,</hi> had God's Authority, or they had not; if they had not, then it is poſſible there may be a King who has not God's Authority, and that there may be ſome Events which are only by his permiſſion: If they had, then God muſt beſtow Two Oppoſite Sovereign Authorities and Rights, at once, to Two ſeveral Princes over the ſame People, and to the ſame Kingdom; and both muſt be equally valid and obligatory upon the Subjects Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences. For by what way ſoever God conveys the Authority, it is his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; and God's Authority is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways the ſame, to whomſoever, and
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:95153:20"/>in what manner ſoever it be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Since therefore God concurs with the Thoughts and Actions of Men, in the Means and Cauſes, as well as in the Ends and Events of Things; and diſpoſes all alike, it follows, that he can be no more the Author of Evil Events, than of Evil Means, or Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or Thoughts. But God may be ſaid to do all that is done in the world, becauſe nothing can be done without him; for his Providence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curs with Men in the performance of the worſt Actions, though not in the <hi>Wickedneſs</hi> of them. Men contrive, and practice Evil, and God concurs with them in their Actions, but only permits the Evil of them: for every Action being a poſitive thing, neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily requires God's Concurrence, and could not be done without it; and every Action, as ſuch, is Good: But Evil is an Accident, it is a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, or a privation of Good; and therefore this proceeds from the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection and Wickedneſs of Man only, and needs no Cauſe to produce it, ſince it has no other Being, but the want of Rectitude and Goodneſs in the depraved minds of men. Thus <hi>to think</hi> is always the ſame Action of the mind, whatever it be that we think about; And Evil Thoughts differ from Good ones, not in the Nature of the Act, but only in the Object, which employs the Thoughts; and therefore, though God never ſuggeſts Evil Thoughts, yet he leaves the Will free to determine it ſelf in the choice of the Evil Object, and ſuſtains the Mind in the Exerciſe of its Faculty of Thinking, whatever the Object be about which it is converſant. And ſo in all other Actions of the Body or Mind, God concurs to the Action, not as it has ſuch or ſuch an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, but as it is produced by its proper Faculty; that is, he concurs to it, as it is a Natural, not as it is a Moral Action.</p>
            <p n="6">6. As God permits Wickedneſs to come to paſs, ſo he orders it for the Good or Evil, that is, for the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward or Puniſhment of private Men, or publick Societies; yet ſtill he does not approve of the Event, but of the Conſequences and Effects, which his Infinite Wiſdom and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er produces out of it. And the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent gives no Right to the Perſons who are permitted to bring it about. For then a Thief would have a Right to ſtol'n Goods, becauſe it may be a juſt Puniſhment from God upon the Perſon from whom they are ſtol'n, to ſuſter him to have the poſſeſſion of them.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not venture to ſay, That though God permits Wickedneſs in the Counſels or Deſigns of Men, yet <hi>when it comes to Action, he either diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appoints what they intended, or gives Succeſs to them, when he can ſerve the Ends of his Providence by their Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi> For I believe there is no wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs either in Thought or Action, but God's Infinite Power and Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom can <hi>over-rule it to accompliſh his own Counſels and Decrees.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the difference between Evil in the Action, and in the Deſign, ſeems to be this, That whilſt it is deſigned and contrived in the minds of Men, it can have no ſuch Influence towards the Production of that Good, which God cauſes to proceed from Evil, as it certainly ſhall have one way or other, when it is reduced to practice. For though Evil Thoughts are over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruled by God, as well as Evil Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and either ſuffered to proceed to Action, or hindred; and if ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, then upon this or that Occaſion,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:95153:21"/>at this or that Time, with reſpect to certain Perſons and Accidents; yet Thoughts, as ſuch, have no Effect, but upon the Mind it ſelf; whereas Actions have a further Effect upon divers Objects, for the tryal of Good Men; for their Admonition or A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment, or for the prevention of that Sin, which they would other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe run into; or elſe perhaps for the Puniſhment and Correction of wicked men.</p>
            <p>And therefore <hi>there can be no E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil in a City, and the Lord hath not done it.</hi> He concurs with wicked men by his Providence, but concurs with them, as if they were Natural, not as they are Moral Agents, by ſuſtaining and enabling their Natural Faculties to produce their Effects; he never inclines their Minds, nor influences their Wills to Evil, but oftentimes o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-rules their firſt Intentions, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts their Will, already determined and reſolved upon Miſchiefs, to cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Objects, that the Evil may moſt tend to his Glory, and the good of Mankind, in the Puniſhment of Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, or in the Exerciſe of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, and other Vertues of Good Men.</p>
            <p>As to the diſtinction of Events,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>P.</hi> 12.</note> That <hi>ſome God only permits, and ſome he orders and appoints,</hi> it is grounded upon this, That he orders and appoints all that are good and juſt, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits the contrary. But then this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment is known to us, not by God's Providence, but by his Law. For Providence appoints us to do nothing, but only concurs with Men, and aſſiſts them in the performance of what God's Laws appoint or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand: The moſt that can be ſaid, is, That Providence may ſometimes be an Indication to us, of God's Will and Command; but that can be only in Events that are miraculous and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural, when there is nothing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant in them to his Will already known and declared: For even Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles wrought to carry on wicked De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, are to be looked upon as falſe, and the Impoſtures and Deluſions only of the Devil.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Of that particular Providence which watches over Kingdoms, and orders the Government of them, and the difference of it from that Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, which guides and influences private Affairs, I have ſaid enough already, and have ſhewn, That God, <hi>with his own Hand, immediately directs the Motions of the great Wheels of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,</hi> but <hi>permits none to move as they pleaſe themſelves.</hi> For I take it to be a very wrong Notion of the Permiſſion of God's Providence, that he leaves things to move, as they pleaſe themſelves; No, he rules, and reſtrains, and limits what he only per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits; and puts a check and ſtop to it, when he pleaſes: And by God's more immediate direction, I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, not that God ever acts at a diſtance, or leaves any thing in the world to it ſelf, but that he ſometimes acts in a way to us more viſible and remarkable; though the ſteddy and unobſerved Influence of Providence has as much of God's immediate Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence in it, as have the moſt extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary and miraculous Events.</p>
            <p>The other Propoſitions are but Conſequences of theſe Three, and therefore need not to be particularly examined; and if theſe Three only were but well proved, and not laid down, as if they were <hi>ſo very plain</hi> to his purpoſe, <hi>as to carry their own Evidence with them,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>P.</hi> 16.</note> I ſhould readily agree to all the reſt, and indeed to the whole Book, as far as it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns this matter, except ſome few
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:95153:21"/>Particulars leſs material to the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of the Cauſe. But I deſpair of ſeeing theſe Propoſitions ſo effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proved, as to induce me to think, that by what way ſoever that <hi>can be thought of,
<note place="margin">P. 13.</note> a Prince is advanced to the Throne, he is as truly placed in it by God, as if he had been expreſly nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated and anointed by a Prophet, at God's Command, as</hi> Saul <hi>and</hi> David <hi>were:</hi> Or that <hi>it is impoſſible there ſhould be a wrong King,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>P.</hi> 14.</note> unleſs a Man could make himſelf King, whether God will or no.</hi> I believe the Self-Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of theſe Propoſitions, can work in few men ſo much aſſurance as this amounts to.</p>
            <p>The Fundamental Miſtake, is, That the Doctor confounds the Exerciſe of Power or Authority with the Right of it; and ſuppoſes, that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one, who has the Adminiſtration of Power, has a Right to the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of it; which are plainly Two very different things: For the Adminiſtration or Exerciſe of Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, is a Natural Act, and may be without that Moral Qualification, which is implied in the Right of Power or Authority. Thus in his firſt Propoſition, <hi>That all Civil Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and Authority is from God:</hi> If he mean the Exerciſe of all Civil Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, I deny it, becauſe it may be exerciſed by him who ought not to exerciſe it: If he mean the Right to exerciſe Civil Power and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, the <hi>Propoſition</hi> is true, but no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the purpoſe. So that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his <hi>Propoſition</hi> ſuppoſes the thing in Diſpute, and is falſe; or if it be true, it is to no purpoſe. And the ſame Miſtake runs through the reſt of theſe <hi>Propoſitions:</hi> For if by <hi>Civil Power and Authority,</hi> he underſtand only the Exerciſe and Adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it, he ſuppoſes that which ought to be proved: if he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the Right it ſelf, though theſe <hi>Propoſitions</hi> were true, yet ſtill they would prove nothing,</p>
            <p>But the Doctor makes an Objection to himſelf,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>P.</hi> 15.</note> which has great weight in it; <hi>If this be ſo</hi> (that no Obedience is due to the Rightful King, when another is ſettled in the Throne) <hi>what does a Legal Right ſignifie, if it do not command the Allegiance of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He anſwers: <hi>It bars all other Humane Claims: No other Prince can challenge the Throne of Right: and Subjects are bound to maintain the Rights of ſuch a Prince, as far as they can; That is, againſt all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; but not againſt God's diſpoſal of Crowns: and therefore when God trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers the Kingdom, he transfers our Allegiance, which is due and annexed to his Authority, whether this Authority be conveyed by a Legal Succeſſion, or by any other means.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But notwithſtanding all this, the Legal Right can ſignifie nothing, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it be in that Interval of Time between the Diſpoſſeſſion of one Prince, and the Settlement of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other. For if the Legal Poſſeſſor be in the Throne, his Legal Title can be of no advantage to him, becauſe his Divine Authority would ſecure him, while he is in Poſſeſſion, as well without it; and when an U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurper is once ſettled, it can then no longer be of any account to him; for though it be good againſt all Mankind, yet not againſt God in his diſpoſal of Crowns; but when God has given away his Kingdom to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, the Rightful King muſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, unleſs he may plead his <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Claim</hi> againſt God's Donation. Before a Settlement, indeed, he that has the Legal Right, has the Odds
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:95153:22"/>on his ſide. But Men are ſo partial in their Judgments, in all things wherein their own Intereſt is ſo nearly concerned, that every one, who were expoſed to any great Danger from the Uſurper, would eaſily perſwade himſelf, that he might become his Subject, and that the Legal King had no longer any Right to his Allegiance, the Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per being, in his Opinion, ſettled e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to become inveſted with God's Authority: So that a Legal Title would upon theſe Grounds, be little more than an empty Word or Notion, and would either be of no uſe at all, or of little benefit, when there ſhould be moſt need of it.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not much trouble my ſelf about the ſeveral <hi>Degrees of Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>P.</hi> 17.</note> and of the Proportionable Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, which they require; ſince I am not yet ſatisfied, that any Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of an Uſurper, though it be in the <hi>higheſt Degree,</hi> can confer any Authority upon him, or cauſe any Obedience of the Subjects to become due to him merely upon that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. But if any Man can prove, That a <hi>thorough Settlement</hi> of an U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurper, does of it ſelf, and upon its own Account, before the Deceaſe or Ceſſion of the Rightful King, and his Heirs, entitle him to the Crown, I will give him no Trouble to diſpute with me about the Degrees of Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement. But ſince the Doctor ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>P.</hi> 17.</note> That <hi>the Generality of the Nation have ſubmitted to ſuch a Prince, and have placed him on the Throne, and put the whole Power of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom into his hands;</hi> and ſays expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, That <hi>he is indeed King, while he adminiſters the Regal Power;</hi> And ſince he has told us before, That <hi>it is impoſſible there ſhould be a wrong King,</hi> I cannot ſee, why he ſhould be ſo ſolicitous to define the Degrees of Submiſſion, and not think him throughly enough ſettled to have Right to an intire Allegiance, <hi>while the diſpoſſeſt Prince has ſuch a formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable Power, as makes the Event very doubtful.</hi> For if God have once made him King, as by the Doctor's Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition he has, then by the ſame Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, the Subjects owe him an intire Allegiance to day, though they were ſure that the diſpoſſeſt Prince would recover his Kingdom of him to morrow. For he that has once God's Authority, has a Right to our Allegiance from the firſt to the laſt hours he has it; why therefore may not Subjects obey him as their King now, who perhaps may not be their King a while hence? Nay, though they were certain that his Royal Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority were to be taken from him in never ſo ſhort a time, yet this could make him have never the leſs Right to their Obedience, while his Authority laſts. If he be <hi>indeed King,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>P.</hi> 8.</note> he muſt be <hi>Rightful King with reſpect to God;</hi> for <hi>all Kings are equally right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful with reſpect to him;
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>P.</hi> 14.</note> and it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible there ſhould be a wrong King, unleſs a Man could make himſelf King, whether God will or no.</hi> So that if he be King, as the Doctor ſuppoſes, he is Rightful King, and may challenge the Allegiance of the Subjects by Vertue of God's Authority, whatever For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces the diſpoſſeſt Prince may yet have: and therefore either he is now thoroughly ſettled, or a thorough Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement is not neceſſary to the obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God's Authority; and when he is once King, there can be no Reaſon, why the Allegiance of the Subjects ſhould in any meaſure be abated for any Apprehenſions of Danger he may be in from the late Legal Poſſeſſors Arms.</p>
            <p>In the Fourth Section, the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor proceeds to confirm his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine

For the ſame words often have oppoſite and quite contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſignifications, as they are differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently uſed and applied by the ſame Authors, and yet they ſeldom give no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, when they uſe them in one ſenſe and when in another, but think it ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, that the ſenfe be limitted and determined by the ſubject to which they are applied, or by the cohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and connexion, which they have with the reſt of the diſcourſe.

The Scripture had never declared any diſtinction of Husbands, yet the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of <hi>Samaria</hi> well enough under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, that there muſt be one, and therefore replied, that ſhe had no Husband, though ſhe had one, who was called ſo; and our Saviour an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers her, <hi>Thou haſt well ſaid, I have no husband; for thou hast had five husbands, and he, whom thou now haſt, is not thy husband: in that thou ſaidſt truly,</hi> John 4.17, 18.

Beſides, if this Argument from the Scriptures making no diſtinction between Kings, who have a Legal Title, and thoſe who have none, prove any thing, it muſt prove too much, to make at all to this purpoſe. For the Scripture makes no diſtinction between Kings, who have both a Legal and a Divine Right, and thoſe who have neither, but are Uſurpers both againſt God and Man. Thus <hi>Abime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lech</hi> is ſtiled <hi>King,</hi> Judg 9. without any manner diſtinction, or explication, though he was ſet up not only by the moſt wicked and bloody means, but in oppoſition to the Authority of God himſelf, who then governed the People of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> by raiſing them up Judges to Deliver and to Rule over them; and for this Reaſon, when they would have made <hi>Gideon</hi> King, he rejected it as a thing, which would be agreat offence againſt God, and a notorious contempt of him. <hi>Then the men of Iſrael ſaid unto Gideon, rule thou over us, both thou, and thy ſon, and thy ſons ſon alſo: for thou haſt deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered us from the hand of Midian. And Gideon ſaid unto them, I will not rule over you: the Lord ſhall rule over you,</hi> Judg. 8.22, 23. And ſince that God was afterwards ſo diſpleaſed with the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring a King, and ſaid that in asking a King they had <hi>rejected him, that he ſhould not reign over them,</hi> 1 Sam. 8.7. The People of <hi>Shechem</hi> in ſetting up a King of their own chuſing, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out leave from God, or asking coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of him, muſt be guilty of a much greater affront againſt God: for they rejected him in a more inſolent and provoking manner; not contenting themſelves with thoſe whom God uſed to raiſe up for them; and not regarding his choice,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Convoc. Ch.</hi> 13. <hi>Can.</hi> 1</note> or expecting his pleaſure in it, they <hi>preſumed to chuſe them a Prince of their own. Abime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lech</hi> therefore could be King by no Authority from God, but by his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion only; and yet the Scripture gives the Title of King to him as well as to <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> becauſe he was in full Power, and exerciſed all outward Acts of Supreme Authority, though he had really no Authority, but by Force only, and fucceſs in his wickedneſs aſſumed to himſelf the name of King. <hi>Iſbboſheth</hi> likewiſe was ſet up by <hi>Abner</hi> againſt <hi>David,</hi> whom God had nominated, and cauſed to be anointed King, to reign over all <hi>Sauls</hi> Dominions, after his death: yet the Scripture ſays in the ſame words, in which it ſpeaks of all other Kings, that <hi>Iſhboſheth</hi> was made <hi>King</hi> over all <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and that he <hi>reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> two years, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.9, 10. And <hi>Athaliah</hi> is ſaid to have <hi>reigned over the Land</hi> ſix years, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 11.1. tho ſhe had no manner of Right either from God or Man, as the Doctor him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf confeſſes and maintains, becauſe <hi>Joaſh</hi> was alive, on whom God had entailed the Crown, as being deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from <hi>David.</hi> She is notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſaid to have <hi>reigned over the land,</hi> in the ſame terms that are uſed in Scripture, concerning the moſt Right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Kings, nominated and appointed by God himſelf. The examples then of <hi>Abimelech, Iſhboſheth,</hi> and <hi>Athaliah</hi> abundantly ſhew, that Uſurpers, tho' they exerciſe the Supreme Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and are in full Poſſeſſion of it, are not therefore <hi>the ordinance of God,</hi> and that it is not <hi>impoſſible there ſhould be a wrong King, unleſs a Man could
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:95153:24"/>make himſelf King, whether God will, or no:</hi> for <hi>Abimelech,</hi> and <hi>Iſhboſheth</hi> were Kings, and <hi>Athaliah</hi> was Queen without any Authority at all, and yet not whether God would or no, but by his Permiſſion. And from hence it is evident that the word <hi>King</hi> or <hi>Queen</hi> doth not always ſignifie in Scripture a Perſon inveſted with God's Authority, though it be uſed without diſtinction; and that the ſenſe of the ſame words in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar places of Scripture muſt be known, not always from any diſtinction an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to them, but from the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances and Reaſons of things; and that if this diſtinction between Uſurpers and Rightful Kings be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to Scripture, yet if it be not unknown to Reaſon, that is ſufficient to interpret this Text of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> to be meant only of lawful Powers; for the Scriptures always ſuppoſe and require that Men ſhould bring their Reaſon along with them, when they read and explain them, or elſe they will make no more difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Kings authoriſed by God, and thoſe not authoriſed by him, than between Legal Kings and Illegal.</p>
            <p n="4">4. But I cannot think that the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction between Rightful Kings and Kings by Uſurpation is unknown to Scripture; but rather that St. <hi>Peter</hi> has expreſly declared, that it is to Rightful Kings obedience is due, when he ſays, <hi>ſubmit your ſelves to every ordinance of Man for the Lord's ſake, whether it be to the King, as ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.13. <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>P.</hi> 35.</note> as to all the Kings of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>after their Separation from the Tribe of Judah: for ſome of the Kings were ſet up by God's own ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, as</hi> Jeroboam <hi>and</hi> Jehu, <hi>and their Poſterity: So that this can be true only of thoſe Kings who reigned, over</hi> Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael <hi>between the Poſterity of</hi> Jeroboam <hi>and</hi> Jehu, <hi>and after the Kingdom was taken from the Line of</hi> Jehu.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>One of theſe Kings was</hi> Baaſha,
<note place="margin">1 <hi>King.</hi> 15.27.16.2.</note> 
               <hi>who ſlew</hi> Nadab <hi>the Son of</hi> Jeroboam, <hi>and made himſelf King without God's expreſs Nomination and Appointment; and yet God tells him, I exalted thee out of the duſt, and made thee Prince over my People</hi> Iſrael; <hi>and all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Kings, who were not nominated by God, nor anointed by any Prophet, no more than</hi> Baaſha <hi>was, were yet ſet up by God, as he was.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>The true Anſwer then is this:</hi> Iſrael <hi>was originally a Theocracy, as well as</hi> Judah, <hi>and though God al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed them at their requeſt to have Kings, yet he reſerved the appointment of them to himſelf; and therefore as in the Kingdom of</hi> Judah <hi>he entailed the Crown on</hi> David<hi>'s Poſterity; ſo he appointed</hi> Jeroboam <hi>to be the firſt King in</hi> Iſrael; <hi>and they ought, when that Line was cut off, to have conſulted God, and received his Nomination by
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:95153:25"/>his Prophets of a New King; but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of that—they ſubmitted to any who could ſet themſelves over them; which was a great Fault in a People, who were under the immediate Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God: For hereby they fell out of the State of Theocracy, into the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon condition of the reſt of the World, where Kings are ſet up by the Providence of God,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="1">1. To this I reply, 1. It is not pretended that the words of the Prophet can be meant of all the Kings of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> nor of all neither who reigned either from <hi>Nadab,</hi> the Son of <hi>Jeroboam</hi> to <hi>Jehu;</hi> or after the Poſterity of <hi>Jehu.</hi>

               </gap>, thereby entitleing him in a more eſpecial manner to his Authority, and ſtiling him his King, the King whom he would raiſe up to himſelf to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate his Honour, and to execute his Judgments upon <hi>Jeroboam:</hi> which Prophecy is expreſly ſaid to be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled in <hi>Baaſha,</hi> when he killed <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dab,</hi> and deſtroyed all the Houſe of <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 15.29. So that though <hi>Baaſha</hi> were not directly <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated,</hi> yet he was immediately <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed</hi> by God himſelf; and the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of his Reign, in the deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of <hi>Jeroboam</hi>'s Family, was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly foretold; and therefore <hi>God's exalting him out of the duſt, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king him Prince over his People</hi> Iſrael, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 16.1. cannot be underſtood of his Providence, but of his Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>It may be objected, That God did not authoriſe <hi>Baaſha</hi> to ſlay <hi>Nadab,</hi> becauſe this is alledged againſt him as the Cauſe of his own Deſtruction, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 16.7. <hi>And alſo by the hand of the Prophet Jehn, the Son of Hanani, came the word of the Lord againſt Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſha, and againſt his houſe, even for all the evil that he did in the ſight of the Lord, in provoking him to anger with the work of his hands, in being like the houſe of Jeroboam, and becauſe he killed him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which I anſwer, That by <hi>him</hi> in this Verſe, cannot probably be meant <hi>Nadab,</hi> of whom there is no mention after the 31ſt Verſe of the foregoing Chapter: Nor can it be meant of <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> who was not killed by <hi>Baaſha,</hi> unleſs <hi>Jeroboam</hi> be ſaid to be ſlain by him, not in his own Perſon, but becauſe he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed all the Family of <hi>Jeroboam:</hi> Which kind of Interpretation ſeems never to be admitted, where there is no evident Neceſſity for it, or not however when there is another more eaſie and natural. The words then are a Repetition of what had been before related in the firſt and ſecond Verſes: God had raiſed up <hi>Baaſha,</hi> and ſo bleſſed him, that he reigned Twenty Four Years; but he was guilty of great Ingratitude to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, and did that which was evil in his ſight, which is expreſſed twice before by his <hi>walking in the ways of Jeroboam</hi> (1 Kings 15.34. and 16.2.) and here by his <hi>being like the houſe of Jeroboam:</hi> for this God threatens, That he <hi>will take away the Poſterity of Baaſha, and the poſterity of his houſe, and will make his houſe like the houſe of Jeroboam, the Son of Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat,</hi> ver. 3.

            <p>But if we ſhould grant, that this Verſe is to be underſtood of <hi>Baaſha</hi>'s killing <hi>Nadab,</hi> the meaning ſeems then to be, not that he ſinned in killing <hi>Nadab,</hi> but that his having killed him proved the aggravation of all his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſins; that when he had been rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed up by God purpoſely to deſtroy the Houſe of <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> he ſhould not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding be guilty himſelf of the ſame ſins, for which it was deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and therefore no mention is made of <hi>Nadab,</hi> but of <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> the Prophet having declared, That God's Auger was kindled againſt him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he walked in the way of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roboam,</hi> which yet he knew to be ſo abominable before God, that he was exalted out of the Duſt, and had the Kingdom given him, to reduce <hi>Iſrael</hi> from that ſin, which <hi>Jerobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am</hi> had led them into; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this is added at laſt, as the moſt aggravating Circumſtance, that
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:95153:26"/>he ſhould follow the Wickedneſs of that very Man whom he had by God's appointment ſlain: And the Word of the Lord came againſt him, for all the Evil that he did, <hi>in being like the houſe of</hi> Jeroboam, <hi>and becauſe he killed him;</hi> that is, becauſe he was the Man who had killed him for the ſame ſins which he now became guilty of himſelf.</p>
            <p>But if we ſhould further grant, That <hi>Baaſha</hi> was raiſed up by God's Permiſſion only, and that he ſinned in killing <hi>Nadab;</hi> yet when he had deſtroyed the Houſe of <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> and there was none left who had a Right to the Kingdom, he then became Rightful King, <hi>and God made him Prince over his People Iſrael:</hi> So that he could not be of the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of thoſe whom the Prophet <hi>Hoſea</hi> mentions, that were made <hi>Kings,</hi> but <hi>not by God;</hi> for in thoſe frequent Conſpiracies and Murthers of the Kings of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> which we read of, it might often happen, that the Right Heir was alive, and exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, which alters the Caſe.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It is precarious to ſay, That God had reſerved to himſelf the Nomination and Appointment of the Kings of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> He gave indeed the Ten Tribes to <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> and entail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Crown of <hi>Iſrael</hi> upon his Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity, in the ſame manner as he had entailed that of <hi>Judah</hi> upon the Line of <hi>David,</hi> on condition, That he ſhould ſerve God, as <hi>David</hi> did, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 11.38. And he ſettled the Kingdom upon <hi>Jehu</hi>'s Poſterity <hi>to the Fourth Generation,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 10.30. But theſe were extraordinary Caſes, and therefore can be no Evidence, That God did reſerve to himſelf the conſtant deſignation of their Kings, though he did ſometimes nominate and appoint them. God's Promiſe to <hi>David,</hi> and his Houſe, was ultimately and principally to be underſtood of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> who was to be the <hi>Son of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via,</hi> and it was abſolute with reſpect only to him; <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon,</hi> &amp;c. were Types of Chriſt, and the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Judah</hi> was Typical of Chriſt's Kingdom, and the Scepter was not to depart from <hi>Judah</hi> till the coming of Chriſt: So that God had a more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Care and Regard to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Judah</hi> than to that of <hi>Iſrael:</hi> and yet the Entail of the Kingdom of <hi>Judah</hi> is ſcarce ever mentioned, but with ſuch expreſs Conditions annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as ſhew, that upon the Violation of them, it might, by the very Terms of that Promiſe, whenever God had plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, have been taken away from them in the ſame manner that other King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms are alienated and transferred: And there is no intimation, That upon the Forfeiture of their ſpecial Favour and Privilege, either <hi>Iſrael</hi> or <hi>Judah</hi> were to expect that God would after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards nominate their Kings. After the ſin of <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> wherewith <hi>he made Iſrael to ſin,</hi> and at once loſt God's Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour both to himſelf and his Poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and forfeited the Hereditary Right to the Crown; God ſeems to have leſt the Succeſſion of the Kings of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to the Care of his ordinary Providence, excepting only when he interpoſed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on particular occaſions, to put down one King, and ſet up another. For if it had been ſinful for any King to aſcend the Throne, without God's expreſs Order, it is incredible that the reſt of the Prophets ſhould be ſo ſilent in a matter of ſo high a Nature, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved and rebuked their Kings ſo free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and ſo ſeverely too upon all other occaſions. A ſin ſo notorious, and ſo long continued in, would probably have been taken notice of by all the
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:95153:26"/>other Prophets as well as by <hi>Hoſea.</hi> The Kings then, whom this Prophet mentions, that were <hi>ſet up, but not by God,</hi> muſt be ſuch as were ſet up not only without God's appointment, but without his Approbation, or Authority.</p>
            <p>And indeed, if God had reſerved to himſelf the Appointment of the Kings of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> his permitting them to Reign without his Appointment, and ſuffering them to ſettle themſelves in the Kingdom by his Providence, could be no evidence that he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed upon them any Authority; becauſe this had been contrary to that Order of Government, which God had inſtituted among them, and in derogation from that Prerogative, which he had determined to exerciſe over them; and when God has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared his Will in any Caſe, we muſt not conclude from any Events of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence that he allows or authoriſes the contrary.
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 35.</note> This we are told in the Caſe of <hi>Joaſh</hi> and <hi>Athaliah,</hi> and there is the ſame reaſon in this; for God may as well be ſuppoſed by his Providence to ſet aſide the next Heir to the Crown of <hi>Judah,</hi> which was entailed by himſelf; as to forgo the <hi>Theocracy,</hi> which he had retained over the Kingdom of <hi>Iſrael:</hi> ſo that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we muſt ſay, that he confirmed <hi>Athaliah</hi> in the Throne by his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, or elſe, that the Kings of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> whom he did not appoint, could have no Authority from him, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any ſucceſs or continuance of their Reigns.</p>
            <p>It appears therefore from the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Hoſea,</hi> that the People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> did ſet up Kings, who had no Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity from God, and made Princes, when God <hi>knew it not,</hi> or did not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of it, and who by conſequence could be none of his Ordinance And how many or how few ſoever theſe Kings were, it cannot truly be ſaid, that there was no Hiſtinction to be found in Scripture between Kings, who are inveſted with God's Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and thoſe, who are not: and therefore St. <hi>Paul</hi> could not be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood to mean all Kings whatſoever, under the Denomination of <hi>the higher Powers, ordained of God;</hi> and ſince all are not ſet up by him, there needed no diſtinction <hi>in expreſs words,</hi> to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form us, that he meant only Lawful Kings; for if he had intended by this Precept ſubjection to unlawful Kings too, there would have needed a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſtinction to know, what un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful Kings we were to obey, ſince the Scripture ſpeaks of ſome unlawful Kings, whom we are not to obey, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs we muſt obey ſuch as are not ſet up by God, or thoſe Kings can be God's Ordinance, whom he does not ſet up: wherefore it would have been neceſſary for him to have diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed between Uſurpers, that are ſet up by God, and thoſe, who are not, if he had not ſpoken only of Rightful Kings.</p>
            <p>But it is urged that this ſence of the Text would involve Mens Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences in great perplexities; for the Titles to Crowns being oftentimes ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry uncertain, great skill in Hiſtory and Law is required to ſind out the Right Title; and after all their ſearch the moſt learned Men cannot agree about it, and it is not to be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined that all Mens Conſciences ſhould be concerned in ſuch niceties, which wiſe and learned Men are not able to decide: eſpecially the Titles of the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperours at that time, and after wards for many Ages together, being either <hi>ſtark nought, or the very beſt of them very doubtful,</hi> the Apoſtle cannot be imagined to oblige every Chriſtian of that and of ſucceeding Ages to examine the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles of Princes:

               <hi>cannot be underſtood only of ſubjection to Powers, that had a Legal Right.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I anſwer, 1. I have proved that there may be Kings, who are not God's Ordinance, and the only way we have now to diſtinguiſh Kings, that are ſet up by him, from thoſe, who are not, is to enquire into the Juſtice of their Cauſe, and the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gality of their Titles. And St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> ſpeaks of the <hi>Ordinance of Man,</hi> or of human Eſtabliſhment, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to which Kings are advanced to the Throne.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If the Title be doubtful, yet the Conſciences of Subjects will not be ſo enſnared and perplext with niceties and difficulties, as it is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected: for in ſuch caſes the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects may lawfully ſwear to the Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſor; and are obliged to pay all Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance to him, unleſs his Competi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor can make it appear, that the Right is his, and not the Poſſeſſor's; and then, the Subjects not knowing this before, are guilty of no breach of Allegiance to him, but are bound, as ſoon as his Right becomes known to them, to yield him their Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, having taken an Oath, or given any other aſſurance or proof of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to the Poſſeſſor, only out of ignorance, that any other Perſon could make out a clear and certain Title.</p>
            <p n="3">3. But granting that St. <hi>Paul</hi> had meant Uſurpers as well as Lawful Powers in this Text; yet the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexities of Conſcience would not have been much leſs, than it is ſaid they muſt neceſſarily be according to the contrary expoſition. For ſo learned a Man as Dr. <hi>Sherlock</hi> could not find out the true ſence of the Text, it ſeems, till now, upon this occaſion, and very few perhaps be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides have been able to diſcover it, ſince the Epiſtle was written.

So that if Dr. <hi>Sherlock</hi>'s Interpretation were true, yet it would not much have eaſed Mens Conſciences, ſince it has been ſo little known and ſo lately diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, and by his own Confeſſion was by himſelf ſo lately ſuſpected of <hi>Novelty</hi> and <hi>Singularity.</hi>

            <p n="2">2. He urges, That <hi>we have no exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in Scripture, that any People were ever blamed for ſubmitting to the preſent Powers,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>P.</hi> 21.</note> whatever the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpation were, tho' we have examples of their being condemned for refuſing to ſubmit to them.</hi> This he proves from the Prophecies of <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> and from our Saviour's Argument in his diſcourſe with the <hi>Scribes,</hi> and <hi>Phariſees,</hi> which <hi>relies wholly on the Poſſeſſion of Power; Whoſe Image and Superſcription hath it?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I anſwer, that the ſilence of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is no Argument, unleſs it can be ſhewn that the Prophets at the ſame time that they reproved the People for their other Crimes, did not blame them for ſubmitting to an Uſurper, while the Lawful King himſelf had not ſubmitted, nor was commanded by God to ſubmit, but had a Right to their Allegiance. For in matters of Hiſtory the Scriptures often give a bare Narrative, without any remark or cenſure at all upon it. We read of <hi>Lot</hi>'s Inceſt, and that both <hi>Noah</hi> and he were drunken: but no Man, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, will conclude that either Inceſt or Drunkenneſs is Lawful, becauſe the Scripture relates only the matter of Fact, and ſays nothing more of it: for they are Vices notorious enough in themſelves, and it was not the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of the Sacred Hiſtory to inveigh againſt Vices, but only to declare by whom, and with what circumſtances they were committed: in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner if there be any inſtance in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, where the Subjects abandoned their natural Sovereign, and betook themſelves to the Uſurper, and fought againſt him; a bare Narrative of this can no more prove that it is lawful, than that it is unlawful: for an Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorical Relation can prove nothing, but that ſuch a thing was done, and in ſuch a manner; but the nature of the action it ſelf with the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of it; or ſome command in Scripture muſt diſcover the goodneſs or the wickedneſs of it.</p>
            <p>But in the preſent caſe the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are not ſilent, but plainly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough declare, that Allegiance is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly due to the lawful King, tho' an U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurper be never ſo well ſettled. For St. <hi>Peter</hi> and St. <hi>Paul</hi> both declare this, as it has been juſt now ſhewn, unleſs we <hi>can ſerve two Maſters;</hi> for they teach ſubjection to the Rightful King, which implies that it cannot be due to his mortal Enemy. And when <hi>Jehoiada</hi> charged the People by their duty to God and to the King, to ſubmit to <hi>Joaſh,</hi> and to depoſe <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaliah;</hi> this was a ſufficient Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt Allegiance to an Uſurper in prejudice to the Lawful King's Right.</p>
            <p>But the caſe of the <hi>Jews</hi> under the King's of <hi>Pabylon</hi> was ſuch, as made their Obedience to them a neceſſary Duty according to thoſe Principles, which are moſt contrary to the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor's Opinion. For, 1. God had commanded both King and People to ſubmit to theſe Kings. 2. They did ſubmit, and take Oaths to them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly. 3. Therefore, the Kings ſubmitting, as well as the People, there was none who could claim their Allegiance in competition with the Kings of <hi>Babylon.</hi> And under theſe Circumſtances, either of a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine command, or of a joint conſent and ſubmiſſion both of King and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, no Man, who maintains the Right of an Hereditary Succeſſion and a Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Title, can with any Reaſon ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to ſubmit to a Foreign Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror. But I ſhall ſpeak more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly

               <hi>at the beginning of the four Monarchies,</hi> and that <hi>the Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the four Monarchies is not yet at an end; for under the fourth Monarchy the Kingdom of Chriſt was to be ſet up, and Antichriſt was to appear, and the encreaſe and deſtruction of the Kingdom of Antichriſt is to be accompliſhed by great Changes and Revolutions in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Governments; and when God has declared, that he will change Times and Scaſons, remove Kings, and ſet up Kings, to accompliſh his own wiſe Counſels, it juſtifies our neceſſary, and therefore inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, compliances with ſuch Revolutions, as much as if we were expreſly command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to do ſo, as the</hi> Jews <hi>were by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet</hi> Jeremiah.</p>
            <p>To ſay that the Prophecy of <hi>Jere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah</hi> was at the beginning of the four Monarchies, is a thing I confeſs, that I can reconcile to no account of Chronology; it had been a much leſs miſtake to have ſaid, that it was at the end of the firſt Monarchy, or at the beginning of the ſecond: for there were but two Kings that ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> in the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> Monarchy, as God had declared by the ſame Prophet, that <hi>all Nations ſhould ſerve him, and his Son, and his Son's Son, until the very time of his land came, and then many Nations ſhould ſerve themſelves of him,</hi> Jer. 27.7.</p>
            <p>And the Prophecy of <hi>Daniel</hi> is only a Prediction of what ſhould come to paſs, and therefore implies no Authority from God, as has been ſhewn before: for if all Kingdoms, that are foretold of in Scripture, have Authority from God, then the Kingdom of Antichriſt himſelf (as that ſignifies either Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral or Spiritual Power) muſt be founded by God's Authority. For if ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Prophecy, in declaring what ſhall come to paſs, or Providence, in order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and appointing all Events, as the Doctor argues, or only in permitting thoſe that are Evil, as the general Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion is, does imply, That all things pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſied of, and accompliſhed accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, are of God, the Kingdom of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt muſt be of God's Erection, as much as any other Kingdom whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever. For Antichriſt is in Scripture ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led King,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>P.</hi> 14.</note> and <hi>he could not make himſelf King whether God will or no;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he muſt be conſtituted King by God himſelf, becauſe all Events are in his hands, and <hi>the diſtinction between what God permits, and what he does,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>P.</hi> 12.</note> does not relate to the Events of things.</hi> So that the Power of Antichriſt muſt be <hi>the Ordinance of God,</hi> if the Four Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies were ſo meerly for this Reaſon, becauſe they were propheſied of in Scripture, and ſet up by God's Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in the World, eſpecially ſince it is ſaid, That <hi>Power was given unto the Beaſt to continue Forty and Two Months,</hi> Rev. 13.5. and that <hi>Power was given him over all Kindreds, and Tongues, and Nations,</hi> v. 7. which is as much as is ſaid of the Four Monarchies; and yet it was the <hi>Dragon</hi> that <hi>gave him his Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and his Seat, and great Authority,</hi> v.2. In ſhort, if a Prediction in Scripture, and Providence in the diſpoſal of the event, neceſſarily implies, that God au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoriſes and approves of the thing fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:95153:28"/>and brought to paſs, then every thing that is propheſied of, and comes to paſs, muſt be approved of by God; or, which is at leaſt the ſame thing, it muſt be authoriſed by him; for what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever God gives Authority to, ſo far he certainly approves of it: But as God foreſees all things, ſo the moſt wicked Actions that have been in the World, have been foretold by him; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Prediction of Events can no more imply his Authority, or Approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, than his Fore knowledge does, and by conſequence, the Four Monarchies could derive no Authority from the Prophecies of <hi>Daniel,</hi> and could be no further authoriſed by God, than they were juſt, and were erected upon the ſame Foundations of Righteouſneſs, that other lawful Governments are ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led upon.</p>
            <p>The Doctor ſays,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>P.</hi> 20.</note> That <hi>the Four Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchies were all as manifeſt <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpations as ever were in the World.</hi> From whence I perceive that he is not of the Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſome Learned Men, who think, that <hi>Cyrus,</hi> the Founder of the Second Monarchy, was well acquainted with the Prophecy of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Chron. Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rion.</hi>
               </note> in which he is expreſly named, and that <hi>Daniel</hi> had explained it to him. However, I do not ſee how conſiſtent this is with the Account, which, as has been obſerved, the Scripture gives of him.</p>
            <p>But the Doctor ſeems to have parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Exceptions againſt the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire; for he ſays, That <hi>if we muſt obey ſuch Powers as the</hi> Roman <hi>Power was,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>P.</hi> 21.</note> he knows very few Powers that we may not obey; for whatever Legal Right the</hi> Roman Emperors <hi>had, who by Fear, or Flattery, or other Arts, extorted ſome kind of Conſent from the Senate, it is plain the</hi> Romans <hi>themſelves were great uſurpers, and had no other Right to the greateſt part of their Empire, but Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is ſoon ſaid; and it does not concern the matter in hand, in the leaſt, to juſtifie the <hi>Romans</hi> in their Wars, though very great things have been ſaid by ſome Authors in their Fraiſe upon that Account. But what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever their <hi>Conqueſts,</hi> or their <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> were, their Uſurpations could give them no Right, but were only an acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental means, whereby, after the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, or Deceaſe of thoſe in whom the Right was, they became inveſted with it. And if this be not enough to give a Legal Right and Claim, there can be no ſuch thing now in the world: which takes away the Subject of the Queſtion; and when we are enquiring whether the Legal Right, and the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, may be in different Perſons, the Doctor muſt deny, that there is any ſuch thing as a Legal Right. For if there be any ſuch thing, let any Man ſhew that the <hi>Romans</hi> had not ſuch a Right, and to what Provinces they had no Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Title, or that they had none to any Province at all.</p>
            <p>What Power the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperors had, and how it was conveyed to them, appears from the <hi>Lex Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Sed &amp; quod Principi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placuit, Legis habet vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorem: quum Lege Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giâ, quae de ejus imperio lata eſt, populus ei &amp; in eum omne imperium ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um, &amp; poteſtatem conce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dat.</hi> Juſtin. <hi>Inſiit. lib</hi> 1. <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.

And by the way we may obſerve, that <hi>Judea</hi> was more imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately under the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors themſelves. For when the <hi>Romans</hi> had given up the Sovereign Power to <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> he made a Diviſion of the whole Empire, reſerving one part of it to himſelf, to be governed by Deputies ſent by him; and giving the other to the People, who ſent either Praetors or Conſuls into the ſeveral Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces aſſigned them: but all the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms and Principalities were reſerved to the Emperors ſhare;

            </p>
            <p n="2">2. As to the Objection of the <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees</hi> againſt Submiſſion to the <hi>Roman</hi> Powers, it did not reſpect the Title of the Emperor, but their own Privile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and Immunities For they pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, That becauſe they might not volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily make choice of <hi>a Stranger to ſet over them,</hi> Deut. 17.15. for that Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon they might not ſubmit to Strangers who had conquered them, and to whom they had been in ſubjection near an hundred years; which was a moſt unreaſonable and abſurd way of argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and fit only for <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> to uſe: for what could be more ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous than to conclude, That becauſe they might not chuſe a Stranger their King, therefore ſo many years after the whole Nation had ſubmitted and ſworn to Strangers, they might not pay Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to them? Our Saviour then, when they propoſed that enſnaring Queſtion to him, whether they might pay Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute or no, gives them ſuch an Anſwer as determines nothing indeed concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Title of <hi>Tiberius</hi> to the Empire, which was not the thing in Queſtion, but was owned by all as good and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; but he ſhews them, they ought to pay Tribute to the lawful Emperors, for ſuch <hi>Tiberius</hi> was acknowledged to be; and this he did by requiring them to ſhew him a peice of that Money, in which the Tribute was wont to be paid; and ſeeing that that had <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Image and Superſcription upon it, he tells them, they ought to <hi>render to Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar the things which are Caeſar's, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God the things which are God's,</hi> Mat. 22.21. Whereby he aſſures them, that they were forbid by no Law of God to pay Tribute, or perform any other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of Obedience to the Princes, under whom they lived, but were in this left under the common Obligations of all other Subjects; and that which they were bound to above others, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned not things of this Nature, but their Obedience to God, and the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of his Laws, ſo as to keep themſelves from the falſe Worſhip and Idolatry of the Heathens, whilſt they obeyed their Edicts, and ſubmitted to their Government: They were obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged both <hi>to render unto Caſar the things that are Caeſar's, and unto God the things that are God's;</hi> to ſubmit to <hi>Caeſar</hi> in Civil Affairs, and to reſerve for God his own Honour and Worſhip. The Title of the Emperor was not the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, but ſuppoſing him to have a Rightful Title, the <hi>Phariſees</hi> denied that Tribute ought to be paid him by the <hi>Jews,</hi> who they pretended were to be Subjects to no Strangers whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, but were exempt from his Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, how juſt and lawful ſoever it might be over all the reſt of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects: Our Saviour anſwers, That the Privilege and Duty which was pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to the Jewiſh Nation, was not ſuch, as to require them to ſubmit to no Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Power; but it conſiſted in the Worſhip of the True and Only God; and that all other Subjection to <hi>Caeſar</hi> was lawful, but that which was repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to their Duty to God: They might not pollute themſelves with Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, nor worſhip the Heathen Gods, nor pay Divine Honours to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors themſelves, nor do any other ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful thing at their command: This was not <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s due, and therefore he could not require it of them; nor muſt they obey him, if he ſhould; They muſt not render to <hi>Caeſar</hi> that which is due only to God, nor deny him that which is his own; but muſt <hi>render unto Caeſar that which is Caeſar's, and unto God that which is God's.</hi> Our Saviour ſpeaks not of the Legal Authority of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror's, but ſuppoſes it, as the <hi>Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees</hi> themſelves did, who put that inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious Queſtion to him; he only deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines what was the Duty of the <hi>Jews</hi> under a Prince who was not of their own Nation.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="57" facs="tcp:95153:29"/> II. The Doctor now comes to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce his Arguments from Reaſon; by which he endeavours to ſhew, that hereby is given the only true Account of the Original of Government, and that upon any other Principles there can be no ſuch thing as a Divine Right of Kings, nor can they be irreſiſtible, but their Authority will be precarious and uncertain, ſo that upon his Principles only the Doctrin of Paſſive Obedience can be maintained. I ſhall firſt ſhew, That Kings are irreſiſtible, according to the Principles contrary to his, and then conſider his Objections.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Kings are irreſiſtible upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Principles. That Government was originally in the Fathers of Families, who by Nature and by God's Inſtitution had ſupreme Authority over their own Children and Servants, is evident from Scripture; and how this Paternal and Patriarchal Authority was preſerved a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong God's own People, but degenerated into other Forms, among the reſt of the World, has been ſufficiently explained from the Convocation; which determines, That when theſe other Forms are ſo ſetl'd, as that there is none who can claim any Right to the Paternal or Patriarchal Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; then, however Irregular or Degenerate they may be, they are throughly ſetled, and require our Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion; it being evident that God has ratified them, when there muſt be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuch kinds of Government or none at all over us; becauſe it cannot be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined, that he will place Societies of Men in ſuch a condition, as to have no Lawful Government, or that none ſhould have a Right to Rule over them: So that it is not the Conſent of the People, nor Length of Time, or Preſcription and Continuance of Uſurpation, that gives a Right; but theſe are either only accidental Means of attaining to a right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Title, as in continued Uſurpations, upon the Failure of the Royal Blood; or Conditions and Qualifications, which prepare and capacitate Men for it, as in other Caſes. For when the Throne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes vacant either by Death or Ceſſion in an Elective Monarchy, or by the Extinction of the whole Royal Line, in an Hereditary Kingdom, the People may, and, in moſt Caſes, are obliged to ſubmit to the preſent Poſſeſſor, by what means ſoever he got into Poſſeſſion; and then it is not the Submiſſion or Conſent of the People, that gives the Right, but God himſelf, who concurs with their Act, and ratifies it. As in Matrimony, it is not the Conſent of the Parties, which joyns them together, but God himſelf, upon their Conſent, and the Contract is irrevocable, becauſe <hi>whom God hath joyned together, no Man may put aſunder.</hi> A mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Conſent cannot ſeparate them, much leſs can either Party revoke their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, when they pleaſe; but <hi>whoſoever ſhall put away his Wife, except it be for Fornication, and ſhall marry another, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth Adultery,</hi> Matth. 19.9. And if the Conſent of the Parties in Matrimony be ſo firmly ratified by God, there is no reaſon to doubt but that God may ſo confirm the Agreement or Compact be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a King and People, as that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a mutual Relaxation ſhall be able to diſingage them from the Terms of it; And he may inveſt the King with his own Authority, and make him as irreſiſtible, as if he had himſelf nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated him, and not conferred upon him his Authority by any interven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Subordinate Means. I need not mention that in Ordination, and in the Sacraments, and in all the Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations of God's Grace and Authority under the Goſpel, Human Acts inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vene; from whence it is obvious to conclude, That ſince in things of the higheſt and moſt Spiritual Nature God requires Human Acts, and does by them confer his Grace and Power, the irreſiſtible Authority of Kings, can be never the more doubtful or queſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, becauſe the People's Conſent and Submiſſion is ordinarily required to the conveiance of it in the firſt Ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of Kingdoms; for God acts as powerfully and effectually by the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of Men, as by an immediate Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand or Deſignation.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:95153:30"/> 2. The Abſurdities then which he would prove to ariſe from the aſſerting a Neceſſity of a Legal Right in them who are now inveſted with God's Authority, are all upon a falſe Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition.</p>
            <p n="1">1. He argues, <hi>If the Authority be whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly derived from the People, who ſhall binder them from the taking it away, when they ſee fit? <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon theſe Principles there can be no Hereditary Monarchy; one Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration can only chooſe for themſelves, their Poſterity having as much Right to chooſe, as they had. And what Right had my An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors, three or four hundred Years ago, to chooſe a King for me?</hi> Theſe are the Abſurdities he would bring all Men to, who are not of his Opinion: And upon the ſame wrong Suppoſition would afterwards prove that Paſſive Obedience is altogether inconſiſtent with any but his preſent Principles, though he has effectually proved it upon other Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples in his <hi>Caſe of Reſiſtance.</hi> And if he will now ſuppoſe that by his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Principles nothing more can go to the making of a King, whether he comes in by Conqueſt, or Uſurpation, upon Defect of a better Claim by any other, or by Compact, or an Hereditary Right, than the bare Choice and Conſent of the People, this is a little too much to be granted; and yet if this be denyed, all his Inferences fall of themſelves to the Ground. The thing to be proved is, That Kings have not their Authority from God, unleſs they be ſet up only by the Divine Providence, without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to Human Law and Right; which can never be proved, unleſs it be ſhewn, That God cannot or will not ſet up Kings in a way conſiſtent with the Laws of Kingdoms, and with the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and voluntary Submiſſion of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. The Bond of Matrimony is never the ſooner diſſolved, becauſe Marriages are not made in Heaven, as they ſay, but Men and Women are at their Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and have a Power of chooſing, whether they will marry this or that Perſon, or will not marry at all, God may appoint the Perſons, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent or over-rule the Conſent of the Parties, and he has ſometimes done it:
<note place="margin">Gen. 24.</note> He can appoint Kings, and ſet aſide the ordinary Forms and Laws of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but this doth not prove, That he will always do it, nor that we are ever to expect it now; much leſs may we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, That he cannot or will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur with Human Acts intervening, and give them his own Sanction. God certainly can, and ordinarily does con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey Power and Authority as effectually by concurring with Men, and ratifying what they do, as if he did it immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly himſelf; unleſs we will ſay, That God does nothing but Miracles, and that ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate Cauſes do every thing elſe without him.</p>
            <p>But to uſe the Doctor's own Words, <hi>God not only places a ſingle Perſon in the Throne,
<note place="margin">P. 14.</note> but entails it on his Family by Human Laws, and makes the Throne a Legal Inheritance.</hi> And after all, the only difference between the Doctor and his Adverſaries is, That he ſays, God's Providence makes Kings by <hi>Conqueſt,</hi> or <hi>by Submiſſion,</hi> and <hi>long ſucceſſive Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of Power,</hi> or by <hi>Human Laws,</hi> or againſt <hi>Human Laws;</hi> becauſe if Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence did not make Kings he could not prove that it unmakes them. But thoſe of the contrary Opinion deny neither the abſolute Power of God, nor the Effects of his Providence in ſetting up and putting down Kings: but they ſuppoſe, that unleſs it be, when God declares that it is his Will to act by an Abſolute Power, without any regard to the Laws of Men, he does not raiſe up and depoſe Kings in a way that is contrary to the Conſtitution of their Kingdoms, ſo as to abſolve Subjects from the Allegiance, which the Laws of their Country require; but ſo orders and diſpoſes things, that Kings ſhall as long remain inveſted with his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, as they have a Legal Right.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Notion of a Legal Right, he ſays,
<note place="margin">P. 25.</note> 
               <hi>must ultimately reſolve it ſelf into the Authority of the People to make Kings, which it is unjuſt for God himſelf to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rule
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:95153:30"/>and alter: For a legal Entail is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more than the Authority of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; and if the People have ſuch an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>controulable Authority in making Kings, be doubts they will challeng as much Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to unmake them too:</hi> That is, as we were told before, no Man is bound by his Anceſtors Act, and every Man too may undo what he has done him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, when he thinks fit.</p>
            <p>It has been already ſhewn, that tho' the Prerogatives of Kings, and the Conſtitutions of Kingdoms may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived and agreed upon by Men; yet God gives Kings a Right to govern ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to them, and ſupreme and ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſiſtible Authority to enable and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure them in the Adminiſtration of their Kingdoms,
<note place="margin">P. 14.</note> and <hi>entails the Thrones on their Families by Human Laws.</hi> And though God may over-rule and alter the Rights of Princes, yet his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence is no ſufficient Evidence that he intends to do it: If we once knew, it were his Will, all Human Laws muſt forthwith give Place to it; but ſince his Providence is not a Declaration of his Will in this Matter, we muſt keep to the Obſervation of Human Laws, and of our Oaths grounded upon them.</p>
            <p>But to ſuppoſe the moſt and the worſt that can be ſaid: If the People did ſet up Kings by Conſent and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact, this is no Argument that they may depoſe them. For a People, who conſent to the ſetting a King over them, muſt conſent to ſet one over them with Supreme Authority; and the Supreme Authority is that, which hath no Superiour, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cannot be reſiſted: For if the Supreme Authority may be reſiſted, then to be ſure all Inferiour Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity may be reſiſted too, and ſo all Government muſt be diſſolved, for want of any ſufficient Authority to manage it. It follows then, That there muſt be a Supreme Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſomewhere in all Governments; and in a Kingdom this Supreme Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority muſt be in the King; and a People, who upon this Suppoſition, ſhould make a King, muſt chooſe one, in whom they place the Supreme Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, that is, who is irreſiſtible; at leaſt, unleſs they reſerve to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves a Liberty of Reſiſtance in cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Caſes, by expreſs Agreement, which has been the Cuſtom in King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms where Reſiſtance is allowed. Or however let us ſuppoſe, That the People declare their King irreſiſtible upon their Choice of him, and eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh that as the Fundamental Law of their Government; ſuppoſe they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige all in any Office Military or Civil, to ſwear, That it is unlawful upon any Pretence whatſoever to take up Arms againſt him, and oblige all the Clergy ſolemnly and frequently to declare it, would it be lawful for the People to recal this Power, becauſe they gave it? Or is it not rather of the very Eſſence of this Power that it can never be recalled, becauſe never reſiſted? Are other Contracts revocable by ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Parties at pleaſure, becauſe they are entred into by Conſent? Might Marriage be diſſolved, when either Party pleaſed, if no more were required to it than the Conſent of both Parties? Or is there any great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Reaſon, why he that has conſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be governed by an irreſiſtible power, may recal his own Act, and reſiſt when he thinks fit?</p>
            <p>I do not diſpute whether it be poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for the People to convey a Power of Life and Death, and to eſtabliſh a Sovereign Power among them; nay, I grant it is impoſſible for any Rightful Government to be erected by mere Conſent and Compact without God's Eſtabliſhment and Confirmation of it; I only ſhew, That though this were true, yet the Concluſion would be falſe, and though the People might make Kings by mutual Agreement and Contract, yet they could not unmake them.</p>
            <p>But tho' the ſame Perſons might not play faſt and looſe, as they pleaſe; yet what obligation could their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drenly
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:95153:31"/>under to obey that Race of Kings which they had ſet up? <hi>For what Rights,</hi> ſays the Dr. <hi>had my Anceſtors three or four hundred years ago, to chooſe a King for me?</hi> I anſwer, they had a Paternal Right, in vertue of which Children are obliged by all the lawful Acts of their Fathers in their behalf, or by the Acts of others, which are for their advantage, when they act as Parents for them. Thus Children promiſe by their Godfathers and God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothers in Baptiſm, and when they come to Age, would be guilty of Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacy, and of the breach of the moſt ſolemn Vow and Promiſe made in their name, if they ſhould renounce their Baptiſm. In the Covenants which God has made with mankind, the Children were always obliged by their Fathers Act; thus it was in his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with <hi>Adam,</hi> with <hi>Noah,</hi> with <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi> and with <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> There is nothing more plain in Scripture, than that the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren had an Intereſt in the Covenant made with their Fathers, and were obliged to perform the Conditions of it. And there is no difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a Covenant made with God, and one made with Man in this reſpect; for it is eſſential to a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant that there ſhould be the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the Parties, that enter into it; and tho' God has a Right over his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to require what Acts of Duty and Obedience he pleaſes from them, yet when he is pleaſed to deal with them by way of Covenant, it is neceſſary, they ſhould conſent to the Terms of it either by themſelves, or by others that repreſent them, and have Power to act for them, otherwiſe, what were breach of a voluntary Covenant, as well as of natural Duty in the Parents, would be only breach of Duty in the Children.</p>
            <p>And no diſtance of time can make any alteration in this obligation, which Parents lay upon their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, as it appears by thoſe Covenants, which God has entred into with Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. But if this could make any difference, every Father renews his obligation to the Government for himſelf and his Children: For if the Perſon immediately conſenting to the ſetting up a King oblige his Sons to pay Allegiance to him, then for the ſame reaſon, they by their Conſent and Submiſſion in living under his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, oblige their Children, and ſo on for four hundred Years, or as long as the Government continues.</p>
            <p>There is no need further to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the Obligation all men are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to their Country for their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection and Education from their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy, and for the many Benefits they receive from the Government; it is manifeſt that the Act of their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents is obligation enough, if there were no other, and they muſt be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged by their Parents Choice, as well as by their own, and are not left at liberty to deny their own Conſent, if they think their Anceſtors have made an ill Bargain. But when we add to this God's Authority, which is conferred upon all, that are duly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced to Sovereignty, we have the ſureſt grounds for the Doctrin of Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Obedience, tho' God do not give his Authority in ſuch a manner as to null or fruſtrate Legal Rights and Claims.</p>
            <p>He next proceeds to conſider the Objections, that may be made againſt his Aſſertion. The firſt is, that the diſpoſſeſſed Prince <hi>ought not to attempt the Recovery of his Throne (nor any other Prince to aſſiſt him in it) which is to oppoſe God, and to challenge that,
<note place="margin">p. 25.</note> which he has no longer any Right to.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He anſwers; <hi>By no means: The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God removes Kings, and ſets up Kings, but alters no Legal Rights, nor forbids thoſe, who are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſed of them, to recover their Rights when they can. While ſuch a Prince is in the Throne it is a Declaration of God's Will, that he ſhall reign for ſome time, longer or ſhorter, as God pleaſes; and that is an obligation to Subjects to ſubmit and obey; for Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:95153:31"/>is owing only to God's Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: But that one Prince is at preſent placed in the Throne, and the other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved out of it, does not prove that it is God's Will, it ſhould always be ſo; and therefore does not deveſt the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſt Prince of his Legal Right and Claim, nor forbid him to endeavour to reeover his Throne, nor forbid thoſe, who are under no obligation to the Prince in Poſſeſſion, to aſſiſt the diſpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt Prince to recover his Legal Right.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Anſwer ſeems to ſuppoſe, that, tho' the Prince in Poſſeſſion have the Exerciſe of the Supreme Power, and do adminiſter God's Authority for a time; or rather, tho' God governs by him as his Inſtrument, while he is in Poſſeſſion; yet he has no Authority inherent in himſelf, but acts as wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly, all along in withholding from the Rightful Prince his due, as he did at firſt in depriving him of it, and therefore may be thruſt out by the Legal Prince himſelf, or by any others, who have made no Submiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to him. But this is ſo direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contrary to all the reſt of his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, that it cannot be the Dr's meaning in this place. For he, that is <hi>ſet up by God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 13.</note> that <hi>is made King by him,</hi> that <hi>is inveſted with his Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> and <hi>receives his Authority from him;</hi> he, to whom <hi>God gives the Throne, and does not only permit him to take it;</hi> he, <hi>who is as truly placed in the Throne by God, as if he had been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly nominated and anointed by a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet at God's Command, as</hi> Saul <hi>and</hi> David <hi>were;</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 14.</note> he, who is <hi>rightful King with reſpect to God,</hi> and <hi>has the True and Rightful Authority of a King,</hi> who is <hi>God</hi>'s <hi>Miniſter and Lieutenant,</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 15:</note> to whom God has <hi>transferred the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> and the Subjects <hi>Allegiance;</hi> this King has as full Right to his Crown as the lawful King himſelf could ever have; he has a Divine Right, and then the human Right, when it comes in Competition with the Divine, is nothing but a meer Formality, an empty and inſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant Word, and the want of it can never in the leaſt weaken his Title. And the Doctor thus plainly and frequently aſſerting almoſt in every Page, that God has placed the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurper in the Throne, I am not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to underſtand how it can be lawful for the diſpoſſeſt Prince to endeavour to recover it from him, which is to endeavour to bring down whom <hi>God has exalted,</hi> and placed there <hi>with his own Right Hand.</hi> For the late Legal Poſſeſſor can have no more real Right than if he had never been King; only perhaps he may have the Honour to be called <hi>late King</hi> for diſtinction's ſake, and to acquaint the World that he is now no longer ſo: But the Legal Right, which it is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged he once had, muſt now be extinguiſhed, and abſorpt in the Divine Right of the preſent Poſſeſſor.</p>
            <p>To juſtifie the King, who is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to retain a Legal Right in oppoſition to the Divine, in his wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging War for the regaining of his Throne from him, who is in poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it by a Divine Right, is plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to maintain, that he may fight againſt God, and may inſiſt upon the Validity of an human Claim, againſt the Divine Will and Command; it is to ſay, that God may diſpoſe of Kingdoms as he pleaſes, but the Rights introduced by human Laws are ſtill in force, notwithſtanding his diſpoſal. For though it be uncertain how long an Uſurper ſhall continue in the Throne, this alters not the Caſe, ſince it is certain according to theſe Principles, that how long or how ſhort a Time ſoever he is in Poſſeſſion, for all that time, he has God's Authority. Suppoſe then it were certain that the Uſurper were to be diſpoſſeſſed at ſuch a Time, it would nevertheleſs be as unjuſt to raiſe War againſt him, till that time, as if he were to remain in the Throne for his Life. For God may make Annual Kings, if he pleaſes, and yet their Authority will be as
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:95153:32"/>ſacred and inviolable, as any Kings whatſoever: It would be no excuſe for a Man, that ſhould affront my Lord Mayor, to ſay that his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip was almoſt out of his Office; nor any excuſe to Domeſtick Rebels, or Foreign Invaders, to alledge that the King was ſick of a Mortal Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe; and yet there is no difference in theſe Caſes. For a King placed in the Throne by God himſelf, and acting by his Authority, can have no juſt Competitor, all the while he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joys it, be it a longer or a ſhorter Time.</p>
            <p>The reſt that follows to Page 33. is a Digreſſion, in which whatever concerns the preſent Queſtion is grounded upon this Suppoſition, that a legal Claim is good againſt God's Authority, with which the King in Poſſeſſion is inveſted, and ſo muſt either ſtand or fall with it. And therefore though there be ſeveral things, which granting this to be true, are unconcluding, yet I ſhall paſs them over.
<note place="margin">P. 33.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Another Objection is, that his O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion would give great Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to daring and ambitious Men to invade their Neighbours.</p>
            <p>He anſwers, that ſuch Men <hi>need no other Encouragement, but Power to graſp at Crowns:</hi> And therefore 'tis great pity they ſhould have any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. But he ſays further, that <hi>if the Kingdoms of the World be diſpoſed of by God, and no Art or Power can place any Prince on the Throne but by God's Appointment; unleſs they can flatter themſelves, that God has ordained them to be Kings, it will check all their ambitious Attempts, which God can ſo eaſily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But they cannot be ignorant, how eaſily God can defeat their Attempts, whether they know of this Doctrin, or no: They obſerve that Kingdoms are loſt, and Kings dethroned in all Ages of the World; and when they have Power in their hands, they are apt to promiſe themſelves Succeſs, without the hopes of any Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but what they can gain by the Sword. And when they are informed, that if they have but ſucceſs, God will give them a Right, which will oblige all the Subjects in their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence againſt all oppoſition, they will be much more forward and deſirous to try their Fortunes, and ſee what ſucceſs they can meet with; and Crowns will be looked upon by bold and aſpiring Men as ſo many Prizes propoſed for the reward of Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. And to this there will be need of <hi>no great Doſe of Enthuſiaſm,</hi> tho' Enthuſiaſm is no unuſual thing in ſuch Caſes: For moſt of the <hi>ambitious Spirits</hi> have either flattered them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or at leaſt made their Follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers believe; that God would proſper their undertakings; that they were doing God's Work, and that he had ordained them Succeſs in their At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts: Or, if they ſhould not be ſo Enthuſiaſtick, yet this would be too great Encouragement to them, that if God would permit them to have that Succeſs, which ſo many others have had before them in as wicked Deſigns, he would be ſure to crown it with his own Authority.</p>
            <p>But to what may be alledged of this Doctrin's being inconvenient, and dangerous to Princes, he ſays that <hi>the contrary Doctrin is much more dangerous to Subjects, when ſuch Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions happen.</hi> But beſide that a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin, which is dangerous to Princes, can be no ſecurity to Subjects, this is not to the Point: For if this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin promote Wars, and occaſion frequent Revolutions, it will be of worſe Conſequence, though the other ſhould expoſe Subjects to greater dangers, under the Revolutions, which would more rarely happen. For Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volutions cannot be brought about without the Expence of much Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and the loſs of many Lives; and it were better for Subjects to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer more, ſo it were but ſeldom, than to be continually ſuffering, though
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:95153:32"/>not altogether in ſo great a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree.</p>
            <p>But <hi>the Objectors do not think it a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Confutation of the Doctrin of Non-reſiſtance and Paſſive Obedience,
<note place="margin">P. 34.</note> to ſay, That this puts it into the King's Power to invade the Laws and Liberties, the Lives and Fortunes of his Subjects at pleaſure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the Reaſon why they think it no Confutation is, becauſe though Paſſive Obedience can give no abſolute Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, yet it is more for the Good and Intereſt of the People than the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Doctrin. For it is evident from all Experience, that Civil Wars ſpill more Blood, and waſte more Treaſure, and deſtroy more Liberty and Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and are every way of worſe Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to the Subject, than the Reign of the worſt King can be. But the preſent Doctrin, which the Doctor maintains, brings Miſchiefs upon both King and People, which the contrary to it would prevent, and ſo is worſe than that in its Effects and Conſequences. There is no Doctrin that can ſecure Kingdoms from all Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and Calamities; but Paſſive Obedience is as effectual to that end, as the State of Human Affairs will admit, and <hi>the Divine Providence takes care of all extraordinary Caſes.</hi> And when it is proved that a Doctrin is delivered in the Scriptures, and has been taught by the Catholick Church from the Apoſtles Times, and is the beſt and moſt beneficial to Societies, that can be taught, no good Man will diſpute the Truth of it, though great Inconveniences may ſometimes happen, which neither that nor any other Doctrin can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent.</p>
            <p>But if the Doctrin of Paſſive Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience ſhould expoſe Subjects to never ſo many and great Inconveniences, the Doctor's Notion muſt expoſe Men to the ſame, and much great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. For Paſſive Obedience teaches only, That Kings may not be reſiſted by their Subjects. But the Doctor goes further, and muſt ſay, That if Kings can once get fully poſſeſſed of the Properties of their Subjects, and throughly ſetled in their Encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon their Rights and Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, they have from thenceforth a Divine Right to them, and their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority over their Subjects is increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and extended with their Power and Uſurpations; for all is the Gift of God by his Providence, after <hi>a through Settlement.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again he objects;
<note place="margin">P. 34.</note> 
               <hi>But have not Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates and Robbers as good a Title to my Purſe, as an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurper has to the Crown, which he ſeizes by a manifeſt Force and Violence? Does not the Providence of God order and diſpoſe all theſe Events? And are we not bound then as much to ſubmit to Pyrates as to <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpers?</hi> To which he anſwers, That <hi>the diſpute is not about Human and Legal Right in either Caſe, but about Authority.</hi> But neither is the Objection concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Human and Legal Right, but Divine Right; for the Conveyance of Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity by God's Providence ſuppoſes a Right to enjoy and exerciſe it, and that Objection is, That Pyrates and Robbers have as good a Right to their Booty, as an Uſurper's Right and Title can be to his Crown; and that the Divine Providence may as well be ſaid to diſpoſe of the Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Subjects, as of the authority of Kings. For though an Indictment, may be brought againſt Robbers in Human Courts, yet by being in full Poſſeſſion, they may by the ſame Reaſon be ſaid to have a Divine Right to the Goods they have taken, and that they are not obliged in Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to make Reſtitution; by which, Uſurpers are ſaid to have a Divine Right and Authority from God to Rule the Dominions in which they have unjuſtly ſetled themſelves. And, this, I think, I have already proved or if I had not, the Doctor himſelf has granted it. Has he forgot that he told us before,
<note place="margin">P. 12.</note> That <hi>the Scripture never ſpeaks of God</hi>'s <hi>bare Permiſſion of any
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:95153:33"/>Events, but makes him the Author of all the Good or Evil, which happens, either to private Perſons, or Publick So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties?</hi> What then can his Diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction between <hi>Human and Legal Right and Authority</hi> ſignifie? I cannot but think, notwithſtanding this Diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that a <hi>Purſe</hi> may rather be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred by Providence, than a <hi>Kingdom;</hi> for a Purſe may be loſt and found, as a Kingdom can hardly be: Yet if a Man ſhould find a Purſe of Gold, I ſuppoſe it would be no Excuſe for him to- ſay that Providence had given it him, if he ſhould refuſe to reſtore it to the right owner; though, in this Caſe, he came by it without any Fault of his, without any Expectation or Fore-ſight, it was his good Luck or Fortune, or in other Words, it was the pure Act of Providence; and if Providence diſpoſe of any Rights, it muſt be in ſuch Caſes where only Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence without any Human Act or Endeavour takes away from one, and gives to another. But if the Right to a thing can remain after it is loſt, it muſt ſurely remain, after a Man is by Fraud or Violence deprived of it; unleſs it be not the Poſſeſſion, but the Sin in acquiring it, which transfers the Right.</p>
            <p>That, which he obſerves of <hi>Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liah,</hi> that ſhe was not killed nor depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed before <hi>Joaſh</hi> was proclaimed King, and placed in the Throne, is only a Circumſtance of Time, not at all ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial. I ſhall not enquire, Whether <hi>Joaſh</hi> had the whole Power of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in his Hands, or whether he could on the ſudden be throughly ſetled in his Government, when <hi>Athaliah</hi> yet appeared as Queen, and cryed out <hi>Treaſon,</hi> not apprehending herſelf to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally diveſted of all Power, as the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument ſuppoſes. But if it be lawful to diſpoſſeſs an Uſurper, it muſt be lawful to pay Allegiance to the Right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Prince, before the Diſpoſſeſſion of the Uſurper; for it is lawful to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſs the Uſurper for the ſake of the Rightful King, and the very Act of Diſpoſſeſſion is the moſt conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Act of Allegiance. And for this Reaſon the Doctor maintains, That in all other Kingdoms it is unlawful for the Subjects, who live under the Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, to diſpoſſeſs him, in behalf of the Rightful King, becauſe there is no Allegiance due to him, till he gets into Poſſeſſion: But in the Caſe of <hi>Joaſh</hi> he acknowledges it was otherwiſe, and the Convocation juſtifie the whole Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of that Action: So that by the Doctor's own Principles in that <hi>Pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Caſe,</hi> where God himſelf had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailed the Kingdom, they might as well have depoſed, and ſlain her firſt, and then have ſet up <hi>Joaſh,</hi> if it had been as convenient and eaſie to be done: But when the Right Heir had been ſix Years concealed, it could not be Safe for them, to depoſe the Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, till be had been proclaimed and ſhewn to the People to give them full Satisfaction, that he was yet alive; and this way was taken, as the moſt Safe and Eaſie; not that it was upon any other Account of the leaſt Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, which was done firſt. What he ſays beſides, in anſwer to this Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and of the Kingdoms of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Judah,</hi> has been ſpoken to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready.</p>
            <p>There is nothing till we come to his Sixth Argument, which has not been conſidered in anſwer to the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Parts of his Diſcourſe. For if God does not confer Sovereign Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority upon Uſurpers; if he does not remove Kings, and ſet up Kings againſt Human Laws; if he limits his own Providence ſo as not to abſolve Subjects from their Allegiance, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring their Rightful King's Life, then it is in vain to ſay, That <hi>thoſe who refuſe to comply,
<note place="margin">p. 37.</note> muſt renounce the only Principle, whereon Paſſive Obedience is reaſonably grounded, and conſequently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the Doctrin it ſelf;</hi> That <hi>thoſe are bold Men, who will venture to ſay, in plain Contradiction to Scripture, That God cannot remove or ſet up Kings,</hi> and that <hi>this limits the Providence of God in
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:95153:33"/>governing Kings, and protecting Innocent and Injured Subjects.</hi> All this proves nothing, but is only the Conſequence of what is ſuppoſed to be already proved.</p>
            <p>His Sixth Argument is from the Neceſſity of Government,
<note place="margin">p. 38.</note> to preſerve Human Societies:
<note place="margin">p. 39.</note> For <hi>if God will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve Human Societies, we muſt conclude, That when he removes one King out of the Throne, he gives his Authority to him, whom he places there; for without Authority Human Societies muſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He ſuppoſes here, that every thing is juſt, which is neceſſary to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of Human Societies; nay, that God empowers and requires Men to do every thing, that is neceſſary in order to that End. Which is true, if it be meant of Society in General, becauſe nothing that is ſinful, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatory from Authority, can really tend to the Peace and Preſervation of Mankind. For though ſuch Practices may give ſome ſort of Eaſe and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection to particular Societies for ſome Time, in a particular Caſe; yet this is accidental, and proceeds not from the Nature of Things; and theſe Practices uſually end in the Deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction or great Galamity of ſuch Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eties: Or, however the Examples and the Effects are miſchievous, and of pernicious Conſequence to Societies in general. The Laws therefore of God and of Nature are, in General Terms, and we have no Liberty to interpret them ſo as to fit them to ſome particular Occaſions, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin, that they do not oblige, when they ſeem in ſome particulars, not to ſerve the Ends, which they were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned for; becauſe God foreſaw all Inconveniencies and Emmergencies whatſoever, and yet he appointed them. We are not to meaſure our Duty from the Uſefulneſs of the Practice of it, in particular Caſes, but from its General Uſefulneſs, and God can provide for extraordinary Exigencies.</p>
            <p>But though God has appointed So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, and will always preſerve Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eties of Men and Government in the World, yet we have no Aſſurance that he will preſerve any particular Society. How many Nations do we read of in Scripture, which God did quite root out and deſtroy for their Sins? and how many other Nations of the World have there been beſides, whoſe Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries are quite loſt to us? The Sins of a Nation may provoke God to deſtroy it; and therefore it can be no good Argument that God gives Authority to every Uſurper, and commands obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to him, leſt a particular Society ſhould be deſtroyed. For God may deſign its Deſtruction, and then no ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion can avail to preſerve it; or he may by other Means, unthought of by us, deliver it from Deſtruction though we do not ſubmit.</p>
            <p>God having inſtituted Society, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, by conſequence, every thing that is neceſſary to Society; but it is not neceſſary, becauſe Man is a ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Creature, and muſt live under Government, that any particular Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety muſt always continue, and that whatever is done to maintain it, is for that reaſon lawful. Self-preſervation is a neceſſary Duty, implanted in our Nature; but it does not from thence follow, that all neceſſary Means of Self-preſervation is lawful; For a Man may be obliged not to preſerve him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but to ſacrifice his Life, when the Glory of God, or the Wellfare of his Country requires it. Societies in lik manner are eſtabliſhed by God himſelf in the World, and we are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to the Preſervation of them; but we muſt preſerve particular Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eties only by ſuch Means, as are agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Laws of God, deſigned for the Benefit of Society in general. To endeavour to preſerve any particular Society in ſuch a way, as naturally tends to the Deſtruction of Society in general, is to act againſt the Nature and Inſtitution of Society, and by conſequence ſinful, though the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:95153:34"/>Act ſhould be never ſo beneficial to a particular Government.</p>
            <p>Now for Subjects to pay Allegiance to Kings, and for both Prince and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to perform their mutual Duties to each other, as far as they are able, is the only Security of Human Society; and to ſay that we owe no Allegiance to an abſent Prince, becauſe God will have Human Societies preſerved, is to ſay, That God will have particular Societies preſerved by the Violation of that, which is the alone Support and Security of Society in general, when yet we cannot be ſure, whether God will have this or that particular Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety preſerved, or no. We muſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh between the Reaſon of Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to Governours, and the end of it; The formal Reaſon of Obedience is the <hi>Ordinance of God,</hi> or the Divine Authority in him, to whom it is due; but the End of it is the Good of Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eties. If the Reaſon of Obedience were to be reſolved into the End of it, the End would juſtifie any means what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever by which it could be attained; but since God, who has propoſed the End to us, has likewiſe directed us to the Means, we muſt make uſe only of ſuch means, as he has appointed; and if at any Time they ſhould fail of their End, as to any particular So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, we muſt conclude, That God has ſome further End to ſerve, and that is always beſt which he has com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, not that which for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent may ſeem more beneficial or expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient. For we have an Eye only upon one Time, or Place, or Government; but he has an Univerſal Care and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard for all Times, Places, Perſons and Governments in the World, and ſees their ſeveral Relations, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendences, and Effects upon one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and has provided for all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind by ſtanding Laws, and has not propoſed an End only to them, and then left them to come at it as they can themſelves.</p>
            <p>The Prince's Right and the Subjects Allegiance being reciprocal and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily ſuppoſing each other (for if the Prince have a Right to any thing, it muſt be to the Subjects Allegiance) it is difficult to determine, what may be done by Subjects for the Preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Government, in Caſes of Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, when both King and People are reduced to theſe Circumſtances, that they lye under an Incapacity of actually performing thoſe mutual Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations; and what Obedience to an Uſurper may be conſiſtent with the Allegiance due to a Rightful Prince? There is ſome Difficulty, I ſay, in determining preciſely in ſuch Caſes, juſt how far Subjects may comply, and no further. But this is nothing to the preſent purpoſe, and ſo I paſs by all that the Doctor has ſaid of it. It is enough for me, that the Neceſſity of Human Society does not imply, That God has transferred the Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the Subjects to an Uſurper. And when all lawful Compliances have been made, if the Government be ruined, the Fault muſt lye only upon the Uſurper and his Party.</p>
            <p>His next Argument is,
<note place="margin">p. 43.</note> that theſe Principles <hi>anſwer all the Ends of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, both for the Security of the Prince and Subjects,</hi> becauſe they ſecure the Prince in Poſſeſſion by <hi>putting an end to all Diſputes of Right and Title, and binding his Subjects to him by Duty and Conſcience, and a Reverence of God's Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</hi> And they ſecure the Subjects by obliging them not to hazard and Ruin themſelves in behalf of the Right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful King, when he is out of the Throne.</p>
            <p>To which it may be replyed, That there are perhaps no Principles ſo ill, but they may at ſome Times, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſome Occaſions, give ſome Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental Advantage and Security for a while; nor any ſo good as to afford a perfect and abſolute Security againſt all Events: But thoſe are the beſt and trueſt, which give the moſt conſtant and laſting Security. Now the Doctor's Principles ſeem to be fitted only for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volutions, and then they teach men to
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:95153:34"/>ſubmit to the uppermoſt Party, as having God's Authority; but there are many Inconveniences ariſing from them, which more than over-ballance this Advantage. For they encourage Attempts upon the Crowns of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and expoſe Subjects to all the Miſeries which uſually follow from ſuch Attempts, before a thorough Settlement, which commonly is a long Time; And after ſuch a Settlement, they ſet up a Divine Authority againſt a Legal Right, to encounter and fight each other, and engage a Nation in a War, perhaps for many Ages; for the Rightful King may wage War for the Recovery of his Legal Right, and the Uſurper, in Defence of his Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſory Right, which he holds in Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from God; and both may do this with a good Conſcience, and the War muſt be juſt on both ſides, ſo that nothing of Law or Equity, but the Sword only can decide it. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all that abide in their own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, muſt joyn and aſſiſt the Uſurper againſt their Lawful King, he is put upon a Neceſſity of relying wholly upon Foreign Forces, and upon ſome few Subjects perhaps,
<note place="margin">p. 29.</note> That <hi>are out of their Wits, and will follow him into Baniſhment, or venture being hanged at Home;</hi> and upon theſe Terms, if ever the Lawful King return, it muſt be by conquering his own Kingdom, for he can have no aſſiſtance from his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, who muſt all withſtand and oppoſe him to the utmoſt, till he is again ſetled in his Government, which cannot be but by Conqueſt or Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle.</p>
            <p>Now theſe Inconveniences are too great to be incurred for the ſake of that little Eaſe and Quiet, which may happen from theſe Principles juſt upon the Settlement of an U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurper, before the Rightful King can recruit his Forces, and make a vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Attempt to recover his Throne; for 'tis only during that Interval, between the lawful King's Defeat, and his Reinforcement, that theſe Principles can be of any uſe to the Subjects; afterwards they expoſe them to all the Dangers and Miſeries of a long War, of frequent Invaſions, and of a foreign Conqueſt; and it muſt be remembred, that theſe Principles give no ſecurity to any Princes but Uſurpers; for lawful Kings when they are in their Thrones, are as ſafe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them; and when they are diſpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed, they are not much beholding to ſuch Principles, as will never ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer them to regain it, but upon the moſt unequal and moſt improbable Terms in the World.</p>
            <p>Whereas, though that <hi>immoveable and unalterable Allegiance due only to a Legal Right and Title</hi> may expoſe Men to Hardſhips and coſt ſome Lives, in Times of Rebellion, and Revolutions, yet this is abundantly recompenſed, in that it is a conſtant Security at all other Times, and will, as much as it is poſſible, prevent Revolutions and Rebellions, and will make them leſs hurtful and miſchievous, when they do happen. It is not pretended that this Doctrin can give a full and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Security againſt all accidental Calamities; but it gives all the Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity that the State of this World is capable of, and all the Security we can have, beſides that of God's Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, to relv on. And we have no Reaſon to think that God by his Providence transfers the Allegiance of Subjects, but that he will protect them in the performance of it.</p>
            <p>It is objected, 1.
<note place="margin">p. 44.</note> That <hi>if this Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple</hi> of adhering to Legal Right <hi>would prevent all Revolutions of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it is a Demonſtration againſt it,</hi> that it is a bad Principle, becauſe it is againſt <hi>God's Prerogative of remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Kings and ſetting up Kings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>It is evident that this Principle was either unknown to the World be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, or elſe that it cannot prevent the Revolutions of Government.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:95153:35"/> 3. <hi>Since then ſuch Revolutions will happen, ſuch Principles as muſt diſſolve human Societies, when ſuch Revolutions happen, or expoſe the moſt innocent and conſcientions Men to the greateſt Sufferings, without ſerving any good End, cannot be true</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>I anſwer.</hi> Though it be God's Prerogative to ſet up, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move kings; yet we can at no time know without a Revelation that it is his Pleaſure to do it, as to this or that King in particular: And therefore while the Legal Right re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains, we may not conclude that he has transferred our Allegiance. And thoſe who are of Opinion, that God is now pleaſed to depoſe and ſet up Kings in ſuch a manner only, as is conſiſtent with human Right and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, derogate no more from God's <hi>Sovereign Prerogative,</hi> than thoſe, who believe, that he has no reſpect to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Laws in the diſpoſal of Kingdoms. For the difference between them is not concerning God's Power; which both equally acknowledge, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his Will only, whether he is now pleaſed to act according to the Abſoluteneſs of his Power, and not rather with regard to the Laws of Men; ſince we have no way to know, when he has transferred any King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, but by the Conſtitution of it, or by Revelation.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That this Principle was, and is ſtill known to the World, is evident, elſe why ſhould the Doctor ſay, That <hi>his Scheme of Government may ſtartle ſome Men at firſt,
<note place="margin">p. 3.</note> before they have well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered it?</hi> His Notion could ſtartle no Body, if the contrary to it were unknown; it is indeed ſo well known, that the Doctor's Principle is new to himſelf, and he informs us, that he could not have got over the Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pref.</hi>
               </note> that lie againſt it, if the Convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation had not freed him from his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices, and given him a Liberty of thinking. But it does not follow that every Duty, which is known, is pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed. Nor is it pretended, That this Principle will prevent all Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; it is ſufficient that it will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent them as far as it is poſſible for them to be prevented. And this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemma will do as good Execution a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt any other Opinion that can be named, as againſt this; for all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend that their own Notions are the beſt Security againſt the Miſchiefs, which they charge upon others, and therefore all may argue in the ſame manner againſt any Opinion whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver that is contrary to their own; <hi>This Principle was unknown to the World before, or elſe this Principle cannot prevent</hi> Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion; it was unknown, or it cannot prevent Hereſies, or Schiſms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And the Conſequence of this is, That either this way of arguing is to no purpoſe, becauſe it will ſerve all Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes alike, tho they be Contradictions to each other; or that there is no true Principle in the World. But the plain Truth is, no Man ever pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to an Infallible Remedy to prevent all the Miſchiefs of any kind; the Quack, in Phyſick, and of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> itſelf, never pretend that their Directions will work infallible Cures, unleſs they be followed as well as known. This Principle would go very far towards the hindring of all Revolutions (but ſuch as God by his Appointment and Command would have ſubmitted to) if it were practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and, as things are now, it is the beſt Remedy againſt them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. But if the bare Knowledg of this Principle will not prevent Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volutions, or if Revolutions can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be prevented at all; it does not from thence follow, That <hi>ſuch an immoveable and unalterable Allegiance, as is due only to a Legal Right and Title</hi> will diſſolve Human Societies, when ſuch Revolutions happen. Our preſent Experience teaches the contrary; for the Diſtinction between the Divine Authority and the Legal Right of Kings in Oppoſition to each other, is news
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:95153:35"/>to almoſt the whole Nation, ſome acting upon one Principle and ſome upon another, but all generally ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing God's Authority, and the Legal Right to be in the ſame Perſon. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, the Government muſt be, at leaſt in ſome Meaſure, ſetled, before the Doctor's Principle can take Place, or be of any uſe; and if the Government may be ſetled without it, I ſee no Reaſon, why it may not continue with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it. For how comes that to be neceſſary to the being of Human Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, which is not neceſſary to the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment of Government, but exerts itſelf by ſeveral Steps and Degrees in Proportion to the Degrees of its Settlement, and never is of full Force and Efficacy till a thorough Settlement?</p>
            <p>But our Principle <hi>expoſes the moſt Innocent and Conſcientious Men to Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, without ſerving any good End by them.</hi> It muſt be confeſſed, That thoſe Men muſt be expoſed to Sufferings, who can neither be ſatisfied that the Legal Right is transferred, nor be perſuaded that they may ſubject themſelves to the Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſor of the Crown, unleſs he had a Legal Right: But then this is not without ſerving any good End; for they ſerve the Ends of Juſtice and Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity to the Rightful King, and act upon ſuch Principles as are the ſupport and preſervation of Human Society, tho the Practice of them may ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times bring Accidental Inconveniences upon particular Perſons and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which can never fall out but in extraordinary Caſes, that no Principles can effectually provide againſt: And God can ſupport Men under their Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, or deliver them out of them, without their Infringement of Legal Rights, or acting againſt the Nature and Order of Society in General. to ſerve ſome particular occaſions and Exigencies.</p>
            <p>The Doctor's Argument from the Nature of Human Society,
<note place="margin">p. 45.</note> by which he would prove, That the Safety and Preſervation of a Nation is to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before the King's Right, is grounded upon the Suppoſition above mentioned; That any thing is lawful which is neceſſary for the Preſervation of particular Societies; which proving a falſe Principle, his Argument can be of no Force. For that Allegiance is due to all Rightful Kings, is a Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>im which concerns Society in general, without which no Government can long ſubſiſt; and therefore if the Good of Society in General be to be preferred before the Good of any particular Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, tho this ſhould be prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the King's Right, the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence would fail, becauſe the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Relation and Connection between Allegiance and Sovereignty is founded in the Nature of Sovereignty itſelf, not in the Being or Conſtitution of any particular Kingdom; and the Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of Subjects muſt be fixed and permanent, not variable with the Changes and Intereſts in the State of Affairs, which could make all Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment uncertain and precarious, and would leave every Subject at Liberty to pay or with-hold his Allegiance, when he thought fit, if the Intereſt of the Government, and not the Laws of it were to be the Rule of his Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. And where ſhould we ſtop? Or whither would not this Argument carry us? For if we may withdraw our Allegiance from the King, becauſe his Right is not of equal Value with the Safety of all his Subjects, then for the ſame Reaſon we may rebel againſt him, or we may kill him, whenever we will ſuppoſe, That this ſingle Life and Fortunes come into competition with thoſe of the whole Nation. But this Argument has been often brought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Doctrin of Non-Reſiſtance, and as often conſuted. And if it were true, it would not prove that Uſurpers are ſet up by God, but by the People: For if God ſets them up, Obedience is due to them for the Sake of his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, not upon theſe Conſiderations, which can only ſerve for Motives to the People to ſet them up, and are no Proof that God has done it. For we
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:95153:36"/>may ſuppoſe the Uſurper, in poſſeſſion of the Throne, to be ſo cruel and ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannical, that the People have no way to provide for their own Safety, but by depoſing him, which, if God have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him his Authority, it is ſinful for them to do; but, if this Argument be true, it is a Duty: So that this Argument, if it prove any thing, muſt prove either that Kings are not God's Ordinance, or that God's Ordinance may be reſiſted for the Publick Good; but Evil is never to be done, tho the greateſt Good may come by it; and Obedience is due not to Conveniency but to Law; and the Laws of God and Nature have reſpect not to any Society in particular, but to Society in Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and to particular Societies only ſo far as their Preſervation may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the Welfare of Society in general.</p>
            <p>The Objection which he makes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his own Doctrin is much more to the purpoſe, and deſerves to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered.

            <p>The Doctor is pleaſed to ſay, That <hi>this is a great Prejudice, but no Argument;</hi> but it is very ſtrange that a Man who has built his whole Doctrin upon the Authority of a Convocation, and durſt never have aſſerted it, if it had not been for <hi>that Venerable Authority,</hi> ſhould now reject the Practice of the whole Church of <hi>England</hi> at that time, and the Judgment of it both then, and ever ſince, as <hi>no Argument, no Objection,</hi> but only <hi>a great Prejudice;</hi> I muſt take Leave to ſay, as the Doctor does of the Senſe of the Convocation,

            </p>
            <p>But he anſwers, <hi>There is a vaſt Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between theſe two Caſes;</hi> which is granted, or elſe the Objection would be needleſs, or none at all: But if nowtithſtanding the circumſtantial Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between them, they be both through Setlements, it is unanſwerable, for we are concerned to conſider none of thoſe other Differences, which he reckons up, but only this of the Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that Uſurpation, the Queſtion being not about any particular manner of Settlement, but in general of a <hi>thorough Settlement.</hi> And the Doctor muſt ſay, according to his Principles, and the whole Tenour of all the reſt of his Book, that the moſt illegal and unnatural Uſurpers, who have mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered the beſt of Kings, and excluded the right Heir, who have overthrown both Church and State, and have nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther National Conſent nor any other Pretence of Right but the Sword, yet if they can once ſettle themſelves in their Injuſtice and Violence to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Ruine of Church and State, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all this, have God's Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority as much as <hi>Saul</hi> or <hi>David</hi> ever had: And if the ancient Government be deſtroyed, and another erected in its Room, this is ſtill the greater Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that they have God's Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, becauſe it is the fuller Proof of a thorough Settlement. But if all thoſe Terms and Conditions are required, which the Doctor remarks were want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the late Uſurpations, the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God will be confined and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited almoſt as much, as he complains it will be, by maintaining a Legal Right. For, how can God ſet over Kingdoms the baſeſt, the moſt unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy and wicked Men, who will have no regard to Forms of Law and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, if the Fundamental Laws of a Nation can put any Bar to his Power? and if they can, is not the Legal Right of the King a Fundamental Law, and the principal too of thoſe Laws? No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:95153:36"/>then can make a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween one Uſurper and an other, as to this matter; if both have a Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough Settlement, their Authority muſt be the ſame, and the Duty of Subjects the ſame, to yield an entire Allegiance to them.</p>
            <p>The only thing therefore to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered is, whether there were ſuch a <hi>Thorough Settlement,</hi> as the Doctor maintains, does infer Gods Authority, in thoſe Uſurpations. And the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor himſelf has determined the point: For,
<note place="margin">P. 33.</note> ſays he, <hi>no Man could have fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen how King</hi> Charles II. <hi>ſhould have returned, who had a powerful Army againſt him; all the Plots and Conſpiraces of the Royal Party were vain, and had no other effect but to bring ſome worthy and gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant Men to an unhappy end; but what they could not do, God did without them.</hi> And when it was impoſſible to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee, that King <hi>Charles</hi> could ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, when all human endeavours pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in vain and to his diſadvantage, when God alone could by his Providence reſtore him, this certainly was as full a Settlement of the Party, which kept him out of his Kingdom, as can be imagined: For if that be not ſetled, which God only can diſplace, there can be no ſuch thing as a Settlement in the World.</p>
            <p>But there were many alterations and changes of Government in thoſe times: <hi>It is plain that their Government was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſetled;
<note place="margin">P. 47.</note> it was frequently changed and modelled, which was no Argument of Settlement, and which was more than that, they had not a National Conſent and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion. Men who were forced ſubmitted to force, but the Nation did not by any National Act ever own them.</hi> Yet when all thoſe changes conduced nothing at all to the Kings Intereſt, but on the contrary were all fixed and centred in this, that he ſhould not be ſuffered to return, this might be interpreted ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to ſignifie, that God had determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, he ſhould never be reſtored; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe tho' they quarrelled amongſt themſelves, and their Frames of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment ſo often fell to pieces, yet ſtill new Models were erected againſt him, to ſet him at a further diſtance from the Throne.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Oliver Cromwel</hi> at leaſt was ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; for he was made <hi>Protector</hi> in the year, 1653. and from that time till his Death exerciſed all the Power of a King: He had brough the Three King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms to an entire ſubjection ſo as to be <hi>able to cruſh thoſe who would not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, whenever he pleaſed,</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 9.</note> which is the deſcription the Doctor gives of a <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough Settlement;</hi> all the Bordering Nations feared his Power, or ſought his Friendſhip, and he had a full and uninterrupted Poſſeſſion for the ſpace of five years. It was the common Theme of his Flatterers and of all the <hi>Enthuſiaſts</hi> of thoſe times, That God had raiſed him up, and they had certainly been in the Right, if any Uſurper, from a bare Poſſeſſion of Power, can claim by Authority from God in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice of the Rightful King.</p>
            <p>As for what he adds to make this Caſe Parallel with that of the Jews un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes,</hi> it has been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſhewn that that was a quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Caſe. For if the Jews had made a <hi>National Submiſſion</hi> to <hi>Antiochus,</hi> they had injured no Body, nor excluded a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Right Heir by it: But a National Conſent in this caſe could have been of no force whilſt King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, or any of the Royal Family had been alive. And by the Doctors Principles the Authority of Kings de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends not upon any Conſent of Men whatſoever, but ſolely and purely up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the will of God, who puts an Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per in full Power and Poſſeſſion of any Kingdom. If therefore God's Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity remained in King <hi>Charles,</hi> a Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Conſent could not have taken it away; if it did not remain, it muſt be in <hi>Cromwel</hi> without any National Conſent.</p>
            <p>But a National Conſent would have been an Evidence of a Thorough Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement: It would ſo; but this does not infer that no other evidence but
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:95153:37"/>that could ſuffice. The Doctor often ſays, that by what way or means ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever an Uſurper becomes fully poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of the Supreme Power, he has God's Authority. So that a National Conſent and Submiſſion may be the more regular and orderly way; but if an Uſurper come to the Throne againſt the Conſent both of King and Subjects and ſettle himſelf upon the Ruins both of the Kings Rights and the Subjects Liberties, this is no prejudice to the Title he receives from God. For if the Sovereign Authority be obtained tho' by the deſtruction of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and the deſolation of the whole Kingdom, againſt all Laws both of God and Man, when it is once acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, it is by theſe Principles as much the Ordinance of God, as if he had ſucceeded as next Heir, or had been nominated by God himſelf, and were the beſt and moſt Rightful King, for all Kings are <hi>Rightful with reſpect to God.</hi>

            <p>I have now conſidered all that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns the point in Queſtion in the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor's Book, the reſt concerns the Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to a King <hi>de Facto</hi> by the Laws of <hi>England,</hi> not as he is Gods Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerent, and inveſted with his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. But before I diſmiſs this Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I ſhall ſhew that it was the conſtant Practice of the Primitive Chriſtians to adhere to that Emperour, who had the Legal Title; and that they did not look upon the Uſurpers, or, in the language of thoſe times the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants, who were ſet up againſt them, to have any Authority or Approbation from God, tho' ſometimes their Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and the extent of their Dominions equalled, if not exceeded that of the Rightful Emperour.</p>
            <p>The firſt Inſtance, I give, ſhall be that of the Chriſtians, that lived under the Jews before they were ſubdued by <hi>Adrian.</hi> The Jews had made one <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chebas</hi> their King, who, it is ſaid, reigned above thirty years over them; this is certain they were a moſt dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Enemy to the Romans for about twenty years in the Emperours Reign. Their numbers were ſo great and their fury ſo deſperate that they became for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable to the whole Empire:

            <p>It will be objected here, that <hi>Coche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas</hi> pretended to be the <hi>Meſſias</hi> or that Star (as his name denotes) in <hi>Balaam's</hi> Prophecy, <hi>Numb.</hi> 24.17.

            <p>But this could be no reaſon, why the Chriſtians ſhould deny obedience to <hi>Cochebas,</hi> if his being, as he was, in full Poſſeſſion of the Government had made him the Ordinance of God. For
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:95153:37"/>tho' he had aſſumed to himſelf more than belonged to him, yet this had been no prejudice to that Right, which was truly his, and which muſt depend upon his Poſſeſſion of the Supreme Power, not upon his behaviour, or pretenſions in matters of Religion. And as long as God continued his Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and Authority, which he had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to him, they would have been obliged to obey him, as God's Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. For if his blaſphemous pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions did not provoke God to deny him his Authority, what could juſtifie the Chriſtians in with-holding their Allegiance? Gods Authority muſt chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge the ſame Duty and Reverence, in whomſoever it is placed,

            <p>And tho' the Jews were to be ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly deſtroyed, and to be no more a Nation, the time of this was uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain; but it was certain that the time was not yet come, becauſe they had as yet a Powerful Government, and ſo, by theſe Principles, had Gods Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; and therefore the Chriſtians would have acknowledged their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, as the Apoſtles did that of the Governours of <hi>Judea</hi> in their times, if theſe Principles were true, and there had not been this difference, that they were lawful Powers in the time of the Apoſtles, being ſet over them by the Roman Emperors, who had the Supreme Authority in <hi>Judea,</hi> as well as in other Provinces: But <hi>Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chebas</hi> was ſet up in oppoſition to the Lawful Powers, which only are ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of God, and for that reaſon no Obedience could be due to him; but the Chriſtians choſe to endure any Torments, rather than they would oppoſe their Lawful Sovereign in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of this Uſurper, tho' his Power were never ſo great.</p>

For we muſt give <hi>Tertullian</hi> leave, at leaſt, to underſtand a Matter of Fact of his own Time, in a caſe ſo notorious as this; ſince the Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence was ſo great between all Churches in thoſe Days by their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municatory Letters, and other ways of Intelligence, that if any one Church had acted differently from the reſt in a thing of ſo general, and ſo mighty concernment, ſo conſiderable a Man, as <hi>Tertullian,</hi> could not have been igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of it, eſpecially after he had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed himſelf in all Particulars neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, in order to write an Apology for the whole Chriſtian Church: And it was not in his Temper to have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled it, at leaſt he would never have ſaid ſo peremptorily, That the Chriſtians alwaies kept themſelves true to their Allegiance, which they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged due only to the Rightful Emperours, upbraiding at the ſame Time the Heathens for a contrary Practice. The Heathens were of themſelves too violent Enemies to need any ſuch Advantage as this muſt have given them, if it could have been diſproved; and <hi>Tertullian,</hi> inſtead of making their Apology, muſt have expoſed the Chriſtians to further Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt and Hatred by ſuch a Defence as muſt have been notoriouſly falſe in the moſt Tender and Important Part of it. To have told the World that the Chriſtians never owned any other Emperour than <hi>Severus</hi> but a few Years after, while there were yet ſome Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains of theſe Factions, which he taxes the Heathens withal, had been a ſtrange Apology, when the whole Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire could have witneſſed againſt him, if it had been falſe. The Perſecutors of that Time were too cunning and too cruel to be thus perſwaded, or affront<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed rather, by what they muſt needs have known to be falſe, if it had been ſo. And not content to have ſaid this in a General Apology, to repeat it again in his Book written to <hi>Scapula,</hi> Governour of the Province of <hi>Africk,</hi> upon the ſame Subject, had been to expoſe the Chriſtians to the utmoſt Reproach and Infamy, as well as Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. And what Credit could he expect in any thing he had ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, if he had plainly lyed in a thing, which was freſh in every Man's Memory? This had been not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend, but to betray the Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. <hi>Tertullian</hi> could not be guilty of ſo much Folly as to think to impoſe upon the World at this Rate; or of ſo much Baſeneſs as to attempt it, if it had been poſſible: It is pretty well agreed among Learned Men, That he was no Natural; and a little Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with his Practice and his Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings would eaſily make one believe, That he would ſooner have excepted all thoſe Churches by Name that had acted otherwiſe, and have renounced their Communion; or that he would rather have ſeparated from all the Churches in the World, than have made ſuch an Apology as his muſt be, if this part of it were falſe.</p>
            <p>This I have inſiſted upon the more, becauſe ſome Men, when they have nothing elſe to ſay to thoſe ample Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies for the Paſſive Obedience of the Primitive Chriſtians out of <hi>Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi>
               <pb n="77" facs="tcp:95153:39"/>in this and ſome other Particulars, make no Scruple to deny the Matter of Fact: Which muſt ſuppoſe, either that he was miſtaken, or that he wrote what he knew to be falſe: But Miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken he could not be in a thing ſo viſible and notorious, eſpecially in that Age, when the Church acted unanimouſly as one Body and Society of Men: And to ſay he falſified in things of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that his Enemies, to whom he directed his Apology, and all the World beſides, muſt needs know to be falſe, is to take away the Credit of all Hiſtory, unleſs <hi>Tertullian</hi> be the only Man that muſt not be believed, when he writes of things of his own Time, and of his own Knowledg, and with all poſſible Circumſtances of Credibility.</p>

            <head>An Appendix to <hi>The Title of an Uſurper after a Thorough Settlement examined,</hi> containing ſome Remarks on Dr. <hi>Sherlock</hi>'s Vindication of his Caſe of Allegeance.</head>
            <p>THe <hi>Vindication</hi> has little new in it, as to the main Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy; and, not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding there be ſome variations, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, the Doctor will give me leave to ſay, that if his <hi>Caſe of Allegiance</hi> be anſwered, the Vindication of it will need no Confutation. But becauſe there are ſome things in it, that may ſeem to obviate ſeveral Arguments, that I have brought, I ſhall briefly endeavour to remove thoſe Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and leave the reſt to his learned Adverſary.</p>
            <p>The Convocation teaches,
<note place="margin">Ch. 28.</note> that when changes of Government are brought about either by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion of Subjects, or the Invaſion of Foreign Princes, and the <hi>dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate Formes</hi> of Government are eſtabliſhed, <hi>the Authority either ſo unjuſtly gotten, or wrung by Force from the true and lawful Poſſeſſor, being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways Gods Authority (and therefore receiving no impeachment by the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs of theſe that have it) is ever (when any ſuch Alterations are throughly ſettled) to be reverenced and obeyed.</hi> From whence the <hi>Dr.</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 8.</note> argues, that <hi>it is plain, it is not a legal Authority, by the Death or Ceſſion of the Rightful King; for we are to obey it as Gods Authority, though it be wrung by Force from the true and lawful Poſſeſſor: and though the preſent Poſſeſſor ſhould have no other viſible Title to it, but ſuch unjuſt Force.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But why may not the Authority be ſaid to be wrung by Force from the true and lawful Poſſeſſor, when he is forced to reſign his Right, or quit his Claim? May not Conſent be extorted, and Oaths extorted? and may not a Prince be reduced to that condition, as at laſt to reſolve for ever to relinquiſh his Right when he has no hopes left of recovering it? and does not Hiſtory furniſh us with ſuch examples? However, that which is wrung from a lawful Poſſeſſor by Death, is to be ſure wrung by Force from him: and the words do not import that the Poſſeſſor is ſuppoſed to be living after this injuſtice and violence. And by theſe ways Authority may be ſaid to be <hi>unjuſtly gotten,</hi> or <hi>wrung by Force from the true and lawful Poſſeſſor,</hi> though the Authority it ſelf properly and ſtrictly ſpeaking cannot be ſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained. For in the Doctor's opinion, it is conferred by God, upon a Thorough Settlement, and in the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of others it is conferred by him, upon the Death, or Ceſſion of the Perſon, in whom it before was: but whenſoever it is transferred, it is certainly given by God, and cannot be torn or forced from the true and lawful Poſſeſſor; but the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Power and Exerciſe of Authority may; and when it is thus gotten, it may afterwards be an accidental means of attaining to the Authority it ſelf. And this is that the Convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation ſpeakes of, that men by wicked Arts and Practices may arrive at Power, and at laſt, when there is no
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:95153:42"/>better Pretence or Claim, may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come inveſted with the Authority it ſelf, as well as exerciſe the outward Acts of it. This the Inſtances ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined of the Authority of the Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian, and Babylonian Kings over the Jews ſhew to be the meaning of the Convocation: for it would be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd to take their words in ſuch a ſenſe, as all the examples immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately added for the explication of them doe not explain, but rather confute and contradict: and if the literal Senſe, and Grammatical Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, as the Doctor urges, ſeem to import this, we muſt certainly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject it, or elſe we ſhall make the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation argue, as wiſe and learned men never did, and then it will be to little purpoſe to enquire after their meaning, be it what it will. But indeed no Grammar nor Logick, I think, can prove from their words, that the <hi>true and lawful Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſor,</hi> is ſuppoſed to be alive, and to aſſert his Right.</p>
            <p>The Doctor's obſervation concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the mention of <hi>a King</hi> de Facto in the Convocation Book, I cannot think, will prove of any ſervice to him; and I believe, he thought ſo himſelf too, when he wrote his <hi>Caſe of Allegiance,</hi> or elſe he would never have omitted it; though now he makes great uſe of it. But the plain meaning of <hi>a King de Facto</hi> there is no more than any Rightful King, <hi>under whom</hi> a man <hi>lives,</hi> whether he be his natural Sovereign, or any Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Prince, to whom he is become Subject, juſtly and lawfully, but not with prejudice to the Right of his own Sovereign. For, as the Doctor obſerves, this <hi>is ſpoke with reference to</hi> Ahud<hi>'s killing King</hi> Eglon, to whom the Iſraelites had been in Subjection eighteen years, without any Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition of another Prince to their Allegiance. Now <hi>Ahud</hi> was not their natural Prince, but only the King <hi>under</hi> whom they then <hi>lived,</hi> and who had then a Right to their Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; ſo that if here is not the leaſt intimation, that <hi>a King de Facto</hi> is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to <hi>a King de Jure,</hi> but <hi>the King de Facto under whom he lived,</hi> is no more than the King under whom he <hi>de Facto</hi> lived, that is, whoſe Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject he actually was, whether he were his Natural Sovereign, or a Foreign Prince.</p>
            <p>But it muſt be obſerved that this is not ſpoken only with reſpect to <hi>Ahud</hi>'s killing <hi>Eglon,</hi> but with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect likewiſe to <hi>Adonijah's</hi> Uſurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Reign of <hi>David</hi> his Father.
<note place="margin">Can. 27.</note> For they ſay, that though a Subject ſhould make never ſo ſpecious and ſolemn pretences <hi>that God had called him to murder the King</hi> de Facto <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der whom he lived, and ſhould have firſt procured himſelf to be proclaimed and anointed King, as</hi> Adonijah <hi>did,</hi> yet this would not juſtify him, nor his Adherents, if he <hi>ſhould afterwards have laid violent hands upon his Maſter;</hi> which is juſt the ſame thing that was before expreſſed in other words, by <hi>Murthering the King</hi> de Facto <hi>under whom he lived.</hi> So that a King <hi>de Facto</hi> in this place cannot be oppoſed to a King <hi>de Jure,</hi> unleſs <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> himſelf were only a King <hi>de Facto.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Doctor moves a Diſpute,
<note place="margin">P. 17.</note> what kind of Submiſſion of the Rightful King may be ſufficient to transfer his Right, and whether a King does not ſubmit, <hi>when he leaves his Country without any legal Authority of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and leaves his People in the hands of a prevailing Prince?</hi> or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>nothing be a ſubmiſſion but renounc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Right, and making a Formal Reſignation and Conveyance of Power?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this I anſwer, that it is of the Nature of Right, that it cannot be transferred without the conſent of the Perſon, whoſe Right it is, unleſs it be by ſome perſon, who has a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior Right to the thing diſpoſed of: for what is a mans own, cannot be given away from him againſt his will,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:95153:42"/>but by one, who has a Superiour and better Right to it, than that which he holds it by. And it is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, if any Submiſſion or Conſent of the Rightful King be neceſſary to transfer Allegiance; and if it cannot be proved, that God the Supream Lord and Proprietor of all things is pleaſed to diſpoſe of the Right to Kingdoms otherwiſe, than he does of the Right, which private men have to their Eſtates, it muſt be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſary that ſuch Acts intervene, as are required among men to convey a Right, which can be no other, than ſuch as imply a Conſent. But what kind of Conſent is neceſſary, and how it ought to be expreſſed is quite ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther queſtion, which depends upon particular Caſes and Circumſtances: and it is ſufficient in the preſent caſe to ſay, that a forced Submiſſion is a forced Conſent, and that is ſome ſort of Conſent, and not an involuntary Act, though not ſo voluntary, as if there had been no Force. The Doctor cannot but acknowledge that <hi>ſuch a Submiſſion</hi> of men, <hi>with reſpect to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
<note place="margin">P. 13.</note> gives a Right, for it is a volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Conſent though extorted by force, as all Moraliſts allow ſuch a mixt choyce and election to be.</hi> But Flight is no Conſent at all, but a declaration of the contrary, and therefore whether Forced Submiſſion will transfer Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance or no, 'tis certain Flight cannot, and that is all we are now to enquire after.</p>
            <p>He argues,
<note place="margin">P. 20.</note> that <hi>Jaddus</hi> begged God's Directions, not whether he ſhould ſubmit to <hi>Alexander</hi> or not, for he was already reſolved to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit; but about the manner of his Submiſſion, that he might do it ſo, as that <hi>Alexander</hi> would accept it, after the Provocation he had given him by his denyal before.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Joſephus</hi> does indeed ſay, that <hi>Jad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus</hi> dreaded how he ſhould <hi>meet</hi> Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander, who was provoked by his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Anſwer, but what he means by his <hi>meeting him,</hi> and to what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and purpoſe he deſigned to meet him, is not ſaid, much leſs that he was reſolved to make an entire ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render of himſelf, and the whole City unto his power; and <hi>meeting</hi> an Enemy is a very different thing from making ſuch a Submiſſion to him. He appointed publick Prayers and Sacrifices to be offered up for their Deliverance, but whether they ſhould be delivered by their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, or by any other way, we muſt ſuppoſe, they left it wholly to God Almighty to determine. And whatever <hi>Jaddus</hi> might think with himſelf, it cannot be imagined he would come to a Reſolution, and would openly declare it too, but ſince he ſought to God for his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection and aſſiſtance in ſo extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary a way, he would in all humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and devotion refer the whole matter, and not only the manner and circumſtance of it, to his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination. Thus <hi>Jaddus</hi> ought to have done, and thus probably he did, and there is nothing in <hi>Joſephus,</hi> that contradicts it. If <hi>Jaddus</hi> ſtood to his firſt Anſwer he could not be reſolved to ſubmit, and it is moſt unlikely that he would appoint ſolemn Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications and Sacrifices to be made to God about the Circumſtance only, and overlook the thing it ſelf, reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving with himſelf, before he knew Gods pleaſure in it, to ſubmit, when he had ſo lately anſwered perempto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily that he might not do it ſo long as <hi>Darius</hi> lived: this muſt be a great and ſudden, and a very improbable change; and very raſh and unwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable, and not to be drawn into example, if true.</p>
            <p>For ſuppoſe, that <hi>Jaddus</hi> was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to ſubmit, ſuppoſe he was reſolved to do the thing, which he but juſt before profeſſed, he ought not to do, this makes no difference in the thing, nor in the Judgment of the Convocation about it, who men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:95153:43"/>his firſt reſolution, but take no notice of this new own, nor of his Submiſſion it ſelf neither; and perhaps for this Reaſon, becauſe they might not give much credit to the Account in <hi>Joſephus</hi> of the Revelation, and without this his Surrender could not be juſtified either by their Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, or his own. But we are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned only for the matter of Fact, and for the Authority he had to act upon, not for the opinion, with which he acted. He firſt refuſed Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, and that the Convocation approves; he afterwards ſubmitted, and this the Convocation takes not the leaſt notice of: but if there were a Revelation for it, his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion was lawful; if not, it was contrary to that Duty, which he ſo lately owned to <hi>Darius;</hi> and to the Judgment of the Convocation. The Doctor ſays, <hi>if they believed any of the ſtory upon</hi> Joſephus<hi>'s Authority,
<note place="margin">P. 19.</note> they muſt believe all.</hi> But why ſo? ſome of it may be probable, and that they might believe? and other parts of it ſo improbable, that his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority might not be ſufficient to give it Credit with them: and it is likely they rejected what they did not men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when it was ſo very material to the Subject before them, that if they had believed it, they would ſcarce have omitted it.</p>
            <p>The Doctor is forced to own,
<note place="margin">P. 35.</note> that <hi>Athaliah,</hi> if ſhe were throughly ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled, had God's Authority, till the Right Heir was known to be alive: though if ſhe had, it may be not only Lawful, but a Duty, to reſiſt Gods Authority, ſince he maintains that <hi>Jehoiada,</hi> ſuppoſing her throughly ſettled, was nevertheleſs bound in Duty to <hi>Joaſh,</hi> to depoſe her, and ſet him up.</p>
            <p>But <hi>aſſoon as the true Heir appeared,
<note place="margin">P. 35.</note> ſhe fell from her Power, as much by the expreſs Ordinance and Command of God, as</hi> Joram <hi>did, when</hi> Jehu <hi>was anointed; for a Divine Entail as the Convocation aſſerts, is equivalent to an expreſs Nomination.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I Anſwer, the Appearance of the true Heir reſpects only the Peoples Duty; but the Queſtion is concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Jehoiada,</hi> and what could the Appearance of <hi>Joaſh</hi> ſignify to him, who all the while knew, that he was alive, and acted all along for his Right and Intereſt, and was obliged at the firſt fit opportunity to make the true heir known? and if ſo, he muſt be found to do it by vertue of an Hereditary Right which was in <hi>Joaſh,</hi> and by conſequence he could not be bound to obey <hi>Athaliab,</hi> though ſhe were never ſo well ſettled: for it is a contradiction to ſay, that he was bound to obey her, at the ſame time, that he was bound to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe her; or which is all one, when he was bound to make the Right Heir known in order to depoſe her. It may perhaps be ſaid, that <hi>Jehoiada</hi> was not bound in Duty to <hi>Athaliah,</hi> it was only lawful for him to ſubmit, as the Doctor now diſtinguiſhes. But if ſo, then a Providential Right may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige ſome Subjects to Obedience, and not others, which is as ſtrange as any thing beſides; for ſure Gods Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity muſt oblige all Subjects alike, and if ſhe were inveſted with Gods Authority, or to uſe the Doctors word, if ſhe were God's <hi>Providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Queen,</hi> I cannot ſee how any Subject in her Dominions could be exempted from Gods Authority, nor conſequently from Obedience to her, while it remained in her.</p>
            <p>Beſides, how did ſhe <hi>fall from her Power aſſoon as the true Heir appeared?</hi> According to the Doctor's Principles, ſhe could never have fallen from it, till ſhe had fallen from her Actual Dominion; and her Authority was at an end, not becauſe the Right Heir was known, but becauſe ſhe was diſpoſſeſſed: for the Doctor tells us, that <hi>Actual Dominion and Sovereign Power make a King,</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 36.</note> that <hi>it is certain
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:95153:43"/>he who has the Exerciſe of the Regal Power and Authority,
<note place="margin">P. 38. P. 50. P. 56.</note> is King, and he is no King, who has no Regal Power, whatever his Title be,</hi> and that <hi>it is certain no Prince can have Gods Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, who is not in Poſſeſſion of the Throne, and then no Allegiance can be due to him:</hi> and the Doctor cannot <hi>gueſe how theſe Princes, who, whatever the Right be, have no Authority of Government, ſhould have Gods Authority.</hi> And if this be ſo very <hi>certain</hi> from the nature of the thing, that Sovereignty is founded in the <hi>Actual Administration of Government,</hi> or in the <hi>Actual Poſſeſſion of Power and Authority to govern,</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 37.</note> if Poſſeſſion of Power be of the very Eſſence of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign Authority, ſo that no Prince can be poſſeſſed of actual Power with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Gods Authority, and no Prince that is not actually poſſeſſed of Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er can have his Authority, then how came the Nature of things to be chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged ſo in the Caſe of <hi>Joaſh</hi> and <hi>Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liah,</hi> that <hi>Joaſh</hi> upon his firſt Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance had an immediate Right to the Allegiance of the Subjects, and <hi>Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liah</hi> even without Diſpoſſeſſion loſt all her Authority?</p>
            <p>But ſhe was diſpoſſeſſed. I grant it: But the Argument proceeds not upon her Diſpoſſeſſion, but upon the firſt Appearance of the true Heir, and ſuppoſes, as the Doctor acknowledges, that immediately upon his Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance ſhe had no more Authority or Right to their Allegiance before her Diſpoſſeſſion, than ſhe had after it; and that ſhe muſt therefore have reigned, and muſt have been in the <hi>Actual Adminiſtration of Government</hi> without any Authority from God, if ſhe could have kept Poſſeſſion never ſo long a time, though he maintains, that this <hi>Actual Adminiſtration</hi> and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe is required to inveſt any Prince with Gods Authority. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe then that <hi>Athaliah</hi> had had a ſtrong party, that me had not been ſurpriſed, as ſhe was, and ſuddenly taken off, but that the generality of the Subjects had ſtood by her, and had not admitted <hi>Joaſh</hi> to reign over them; this is no impoſſible Suppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for the ſame thing happened to <hi>David</hi> himſelf, when <hi>Iſhboſheth</hi> was ſet up againſt him, and therefore might have happened to any of his Line: When then would the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity have been? or what would the Divine Entail have ſignified to <hi>Joaſh,</hi> according to theſe Principles? Could <hi>Joaſh</hi> have had God's Authority, tho' he was out of Poſſeſſion? Then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Kings, though they be diſpoſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, may have it too, and Poſſeſſion is not neceſſary to the being inveſted with God's Authority: Or did God by this Entail alter the Nature of things, and was Sovereignty quite another thing in the Kingdom of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah,</hi> than it is in other Kingdoms? Then all the Examples the Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion brings from that Kingdom are to no purpoſe.</p>
            <p>We are told, that if <hi>Joaſh</hi> did but appear, or was known to be alive, it was enough to put <hi>Athaliah</hi> out of all her Providential Right, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it could not be neceſſary, that he ſhould be either accepted or recogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed to make the Subjects Allegiance become due to him. And in other Kingdoms a thorough Settlement is neceſſary only for Uſurpers: For <hi>when there is a Right,
<note place="margin">P. 28.</note> nothing more is neceſſary to give Poſſeſſion, but that Subjects actually own and recognize that Right, and accept him for their King in whom the Right is: For his Right makes their Obedience a Duty, when he is in Poſſeſſion, how weak and unſettled ſoever his Government is. But when a Prince has no legal Right to the Crown, nor conſequently to the Obedience of his Subjects, it is only a thorough Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which makes Obedience a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Duty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But there is no ground for this Diſtinction, becauſe if God have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of a Crown, all human Claims can be of no validity againſt his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:95153:44"/>and that Prince muſt be an Uſurper upon Gods Authority, who will attempt to recover it. For, ſince both Legal Entails, and thorough Settlements are Acts of Gods Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; ſince <hi>it is all but Providence ſtill,</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 45.</note> as the Doctor ſays, the latter Act of Providence muſt ſtand good againſt the former, the effect where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of muſt be aboliſhed by the latter: If God firſt gives a Kingdom to one, and afterwards takes it away to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow it upon another, certainly the laſt Gift muſt take place: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Uſurper is to be adhered to rather than the late Legal King, unleſs Providence advance him to a thorough Settlement, and ſo cancel the Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers Claim, making the Crown over again to the Legal Poſſeſſor by a new Gift.</p>
            <p>Jeroboam <hi>was placed on the Throne of</hi> Iſrael <hi>by God's Nomination,
<note place="margin">P. 34.</note> and reigned as long as he lived, but for his ſins God would not entail the Kingdom on his Family.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At the ſame time that God nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated <hi>Jeroboam</hi> by his Prophet <hi>Ahi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jah,</hi> he made a conditional Entail of the Kingdom upon his Family, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 2. but <hi>Jeroboam</hi> not performing the conditions, it was of no benefit to him.</p>
            <p>And it is not certain that <hi>Jeroboam</hi> was placed on the Throne of <hi>Iſrael</hi> by Gods Nomination: For though he was at firſt nominated by God, yet very Learned Men underſtand <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 4.8. to be meant particularly of him, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding it, that <hi>Jeroboam</hi> is ſaid to <hi>reign but not by God,</hi> becauſe when God had promiſed to give him the Ten Tribes, he did not wait Gods Time, to receive the Kingdom from him, but was ſet up by the People, and ſtrengthened himſelf by Idolatry, and the Iſraelites are ſaid to have <hi>rebelled againſt the Houſe of</hi> David <hi>unto this Day,</hi> that is, from the beginning of <hi>Jeroboam's</hi> Reign, to the time of the writing of that Book 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 12.19.</p>
            <p>As to the Arguments which prove, that Fraud and Violence may give a Right to an Eſtate, as well as Uſurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to a Crown, the Doctor ſays,
<note place="margin">P. 46.</note> that <hi>all private Injuries are reſerved by God himſelf to the Correction and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs of publick Government, and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Courts of Juſtice, and therefore his Providence has no effect as all on ſuch perſonal Rights, but the very nature of the thing proves that ſuch diſputes, which are too big for a legal Deciſion, or any human Courts, for the Deciſion whereof God has erected no univerſal Tribunal on Earth, he has reſerved to his own judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſuch as the Correction of Sovereign Princes, and the transferring Kingdoms and Empires,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But he ſays in his <hi>Caſe of Allegiance,</hi> that <hi>the Scripture never ſpeaks of Gods bare permiſſion of any Events,
<note place="margin">P. 12.</note> but makes him the Author of all the Good or Evil, which happens either to private Perſons or publick Societies, and that all Events which are for the good or evil of private Men or publick Societies are ordered by him.</hi> Here he makes God the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of all Events alike, whether they befal private Men or publick Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and if he will now argue that God diſpoſes of Kingdoms otherwiſe than of private Eſtates, firſt this muſt be proved; and if it were proved, yet he muſt maintain the Conſequence of his own Principles about Events, or elſe renounce them: For when he is charged with the Conſequence of ſome of his Principles, it is not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to ſay, that the ſame thing may be proved by another Argument; though this might be ſufficient for his Cauſe, yet it would not be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for his own Vindication.</p>
            <p>Beſides, the Diſpute is neither con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning unjuſt Poſſeſſions of King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms by Uſurpation, nor of private Eſtates by Fraud, or any other Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, till both are throughly ſettled: Suppoſe then that by falſe Witneſſes, or by falſe Deeds, or Bribery, or by whatever other wicked means a Man
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:95153:44"/>gets into quiet Poſſeſſion of anothers Eſtate; ſuppoſe the Cauſe has gone againſt the lawful Poſſeſſor in all the Courts of Judicature; the Queſtion is what Title this Man has to this Eſtate, who has thus unjuſtly got it? Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence has given it him; he is fully poſſeſſed of it, the Courts of Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture have all determined for him; there is no higher Appeal upon Earth, and God, if he be the <hi>Author</hi> of all Events, and does not only permit them, has beſtowed it upon him. The Doctor ſays,
<note place="margin">P. 47.</note> that when a private Man <hi>has the Poſſeſſion of his Eſtate given him by Law, whether right or wrong, be muſt not be violently diſpoſſeſſed again:</hi> But has he a Divine Right to this Eſtate or no? Providence has as evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently declared for him, as ever it did for any Uſurper, and he wants no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but human Right &amp; that accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to theſe Principles makes no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference: But he has the Colour and Formality of that too, having the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion of the Law on his ſide. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe again, that a Man finds a Summ of Mony, which he knows the Own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of, and that the Owner has no proof of his having found it, and the Laws of the Land cannot force him to reſtore it; muſt this Man reſtore this Mony, which is the Gift of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, or may he keep it? Or has the Owner loſt his Right by loſing the Poſſeſſion, when it is beyond all poſſibility of Recovery? And is an Uſurper after a thorough Settlement obliged to reſign his Throne to the Rightful King? Or is not he and his Party as much obliged in Conſcience to make Reſtitution and Reparation to the Rightful King, as private Men are obliged to make Reparation for thoſe Wrongs and Damages, which no human Courts may be able to take Cognizance of?</p>
            <p>He ſays,
<note place="margin">P. 62.</note> that all, which he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took to prove is, <hi>that when a Rightful King is diſpoſſeſſed, Subjects may own and ſubmit to the King, who is ſettled in the Poſſeſſion of the Throne.</hi> But when the Arguments from the late Uſurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion come to be anſwered, he makes a Diſtinction between what is <hi>lawful</hi> to be done,
<note place="margin">P. 66.</note> and that which is a <hi>neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Duty,</hi> confeſſing that it was law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to ſubmit to <hi>Cromwel,</hi> though he never was throughly ſettled, but aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerting that it was not a Duty; and that he never was throughly ſettled he proves, becauſe he never was ſettled by a National Submiſſion and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, which he makes neceſſary to a thorough Settlement.</p>
            <p>I anſwer 1. The Diſtinction was no Rule of Practice to the Loyaliſts of thoſe times who never owned, that they might lawfully comply, but always profeſſed, that they were bound in Conſcience not to do it. And the Doctor himſelf ſets it down in the Objection, that <hi>the Loyal Nobility,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Caſe of Al.</hi> P. 46, 47.</note> Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try and Clergy thought themſelves bound in Conſcience to oppoſe that <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpation at their utmoſt Peril:</hi> And in his Anſwer ſays, that there was then <hi>ſuch an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſion on the Rights and Liberties of their Country (which are as ſacred as the Rights of the King) as required the utmoſt Oppoſition that could be made.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. They muſt have been obliged in Conſcience to Submiſſion by the Dr's Principles, though <hi>Cromwells</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment had been never throughly ſettled. For the Doctor lays down <hi>ſeveral Duties,
<note place="margin">Ib. P. 17.</note> which in Reaſon we ought to pay to an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurper,</hi> before a thorough Settlement. <hi>As to live qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly and peaceably under his Government, and to promiſe or ſwear, or give any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſecurity, that we will do ſo, if it be demanded.</hi> And <hi>we muſt pay Taxes to him, for theſe were due to the Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of Government, as St.</hi> Paul <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, For this Cauſe pay ye Tribute alſo,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>We muſt give the Title of King to ſuch a Prince, when we live in the Country, where he is owned for King. Nay we muſt pray for him, under the Title of King, for we are bound to pray for all who are in Authority.</hi> All this
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:95153:45"/>is as applicable to a <hi>Protector</hi> as to a <hi>King,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ib. P. 18.</note> and <hi>thus far the Doctor thinks the doubtful Poſſeſſion of the Throne obliges us.</hi> He ſuppoſes indeed that the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality of the Nation have ſubmitted to the Uſurper, and that his Poſſeſſion is doubtful upon the account of the formidable Power which the lawful King yet retains: but I would know, why all Settlements of Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, if they be in the ſame Degree, do not oblige to the ſame Duties, ſince it is the Settlement in it ſelf conſidered, and not the manner, or kind of it, which lays the Obligation upon the Subjects, and therefore if there may be the ſame Settlement in <hi>Degree,</hi> without the Conſent of the generality of the People, when the Forces of the Rightful King is quite broken, that there may be with their Conſent, when he has yet a formida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Power, the Subjects muſt in both caſes ſtand obliged to pay the ſame Duties to an Uſurper; and upon theſe grounds no Duty could be juſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed to <hi>Cromwel,</hi> which is oweing where the Poſſeſſion is doubtful, when by the Doctor's confeſſion, <hi>no man could have foreſeen how King Charles 2d. ſhould have returned,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ib. P. 33.</note> and God alone was able to effect it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Doctor is not conſiſtent with himſelf in his account of a Thorough Settlement:
<note place="margin">Ib. P. 9.</note> 
               <hi>when the whole Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Government, and the whole Power of the Nation is in the hands of the Prince, when every thing is done in his Name and by his Authourity, when the Eſtates of the Realm, and the great body of the Nation has ſubmitted to him, and thoſe, who will not ſubmit can be cruſhed by him, whenever he pleaſes, if this be not a ſettled Government, he deſpairs of every knowing what it is.</hi> And in his <hi>Vindication</hi> he ſays,
<note place="margin">Vind. P. 22.</note> that in this place he has ſtated what a Thorough Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement is: yet here he has not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined, what is neceſſary to it, nor whether all theſe things muſt meet together, or whether ſome one or more of them may be ſufficient.
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Caſe.</hi> P. 13.</note> Soon after he obſerves <hi>there are very diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent ways,</hi> whereby Princes aſcend the Throne, <hi>ſometimes by the Election of the People; ſometimes by Conqueſt: but all theſe waies, or any other that can be thought of, are governed and determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the Divine Providence, and the Prince thus advanced is as truly placed in the Throne by God, as if he had been expreſſly nominated and anointed by a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet at Gods command, as</hi> Saul <hi>and</hi> David <hi>were.</hi> Here is all aſcribed to Gods Providence in placing a King upon the Throne, and therefore the Submiſſion of the People cannot be neceſſary, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs God cannot do it without their Submiſſion, or unleſs <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>David</hi> were not Kings upon Gods Nomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, till the People had accepted them, or would never have been Kings, if the People had refuſed to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit and acknowledge them.
<note place="margin">Ib. P. 14.</note> Upon theſe Grounds he aſſerts in his Fourth Propoſition, that <hi>it is impoſſible there ſhould be a wrong King</hi> &amp;c. but it is very poſſible, there may be a King without a National Submiſſion to him, and therefore either this Submiſſion is nor neceſſary to a thorough Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; or a thorough Settlement is not neceſſary to the conſtituting one of the <hi>Providential</hi> Kings.
<note place="margin">Ib. P. 17.</note> Afterwards the Doctor ſuppoſes, that though <hi>the generality of the Nation ſubmit to ſuch a Prince, and place him on the Throne, and put the whole Power of the Kingdome into his hands, yet it may be, we cannot yet think the Providence of God has ſettled him in the Throne, while the diſpoſſeſſed Prince has alſo ſuch a formidable Power, as makes the event very doubtful.</hi> But in the ſame Page, he ſays, <hi>he is indeed King while he adminiſters the legal Right Power, though we may not think him ſo well ſettled in his Government, as to</hi> all <hi>intents and purpoſes to own him for our King.</hi> So that Submiſſion may make a King even before a Thorough Settlement, though not perhaps to all intents and purpoſes. Again <hi>I
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:95153:45"/>cannot ſee when to fix the foundation of Government,
<note place="margin">Ib. P. 24.</note> but in the Providence of God, who either by the Choice of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor or ſtronger part of the People, or by Conqueſt, or by Submiſſion, and the long ſucceſſive continuance of Power, or by humane Laws, gives a Prince and his Family Poſſeſſion of the Throne,</hi> &amp;c. In this place he joyns <hi>Submiſſion</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance</hi> of Government together, but makes Conqueſt as well as any of the reſt to be <hi>alone</hi> ſufficient; and the Providence of God makes Kings by the choice of the <hi>ſtronger</hi> though they be not the <hi>major</hi> part of the People. In the next Page;
<note place="margin">Ib. P. 25.</note> 
               <hi>if the ſole Authority of Government be from God, and God gives this Authority only by placing a Prince in the Throne, then by whatſoever means he does it, is the ſame thing,</hi> and therefore if he does it without the Submiſſion or Conſent of the People. In the caſe of <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes</hi> the Doctor determines,
<note place="margin">Ib. P. 48.</note> that <hi>a long Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance is required to ſettle a Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> when there is no National Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion;
<note place="margin">P. 51.</note> And <hi>when there is nothing but mere Force, it may admit ſome Diſpute, when the Government is ſettled.</hi> By this it ſeems that though it may perhaps admit of ſome diſpute, whether <hi>Cromwels</hi> Government was ſettled or no; yet a Government may ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times be ſettled by mere <hi>Force,</hi> and Continuance may be ſufficient with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a National Conſent. But in the Vindication, <hi>the general Submiſſion of</hi> the <hi>People is neceſſary to a thorough Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement of ſuch new Governments;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Vind. P. 32. Ib. P. 22.</note> and <hi>the principal part of it is</hi> this, <hi>viz. when the Eſtates of the Realm,</hi> and <hi>the great Body of the Nation has ſubmitted to ſuch a Prince:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ib. P. 67.</note> though once more, either Submiſſion or Continuance will ſuffice.</p>
            <p>But it muſt not be omitted, that the Doctor now ſays, that <hi>the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and Submiſſion of the People, turn that which was originally no more but Force into a Civil and Legal Authority,
<note place="margin">Ib. P. 16.</note> by giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves up to the Government of the Prince:</hi> this, if Submiſſion be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to a thorough Settlement, takes away the ſubject of the queſtion, which is whether a thorough Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment without any Civil or Legal Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, be of it ſelf ſufficient to enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle an Uſurper to the Allegiance of the Subjects by virtue of Gods Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, <hi>notwithſtanding any Claim, Right, Title, or Intereſt,</hi> which the diſpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed Prince can <hi>challenge to his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, Kingdome or Empire.</hi> And beſides, this raiſes a new and a very nice diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute; Whether the legal Kings civil and legal Right, or the Uſurpers civil and legal Authority make the better Claim, and ought to have the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference.</p>
            <p n="4">4. A National Submiſſion and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent is not neceſſary to a thorough Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement by the Doctor's Principles. By his Principles the thorough Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is made by God himſelf, and the People are not neceſſarily ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to have any thing to do in it, but only are obliged in conſcience to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, when it is once brought about by the Divine Providence. For if God be the Author of all events, if <hi>all Kings be equally rightful with reſpect to God,</hi> by whatſoever way <hi>that can be thought of,</hi> they are advanced to the Throne, and ſettled in it, then a National Submiſſion and Conſent can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be neceſſary to a thorough Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: becauſe a Prince may by Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Force, or by an Army of his own Subjects attain to a thorough Settlement againſt the Conſent of the People, and without any but a forc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Submiſſion, at moſt; and this the Doctor will not allow to be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient. For he cannot deny but that in the late times, <hi>Men who were forced,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Caſe.</hi> P. 47.</note> ſubmitted by Force,</hi> and his only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception is that <hi>the Nation did not by any National Act own</hi> thoſe Uſurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. And this is all, that, what he has now added in his <hi>Vindication,</hi> can amount to. So that <hi>Cromwell</hi> was throughly, that is, fully ſettled,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:95153:46"/>becauſe the whole Nation was forced to ſubmit to him, and could never reſcue themſelves from that Force till his Death; he was not ſettled by any National Submiſſion and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, but he was ſettled by a forced Submiſſion, which is one way whereby a thorough Settlement may be attained, and a <hi>National Act</hi> of Submiſſion and Conſent is another; but by whatever way the thorough Settlement be obtained, God muſt certainly be the Author of it, if he be the Author of all Events, and whatever kind of thorough Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement <hi>Cromwell</hi> had, 'tis certain, he had the Supream Power fully in his own hands, and therefore by the Doctors Principles could not fail of having Gods Authority.
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Caſe.</hi> P. 15.</note> 
               <hi>For ſince Power will govern, God ſo orders it, by his Providence, as never to entruſt Sovereign Power in any mans hand, to whom he does not give the Sovereign Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; Power does not give Right and Authority to govern, but is a certain ſign to us, that where God has placed and ſettled the Power, be has given the Authority.</hi> Now no man can ſay that God never <hi>places and ſettles Power</hi> without the Peoples Submiſſion and Conſent, or that <hi>Cromwells</hi> Power was not ſettled for five years together as much as it could be without a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Conſent, and conſequently he muſt have had Gods Authority by the Doctors Principles, though <hi>the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion did not by any National Act ever own him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And it is the ſame thing, as to the extent of Power: for God cannot be confined to give juſt ſuch a Meaſure of Power, as ſhall ſuit with the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del of this or that particular Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Who will ſay, that God can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not turn a Civil into a Deſpotick Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, or can deny by the Doctors Principles, that he has conſtituted him an Arbitrary Monarch, whom he has entruſted with Arbitrary Power? The Queſtion is not, whether God cannot make Kings by his Providence, who yet may be limited in the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of their Government by humane Laws? But, whether God does not inveſt them with an unli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited Sovereign Authority, who can by any means attain to a ſettled Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of it, or even but to the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of it? For I ſhall ſhew that by the Doctors Principles the Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of Power is ſufficient without the Settlement of it. God changes times and ſeaſons, Governments, and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours, and all this he does only by his Providence, that is, in the Drs. ſenſe merely by the Events of things: and therefore when any Prince makes himſelf Arbitrary, God has changed the Government, as when an Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per gets into the Throne he has chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the Governour. And according to the Dr. Authority is inſeparable from the Poſſeſſion of Power, and therefore the Exerciſe of Arbitrary Power, or the actual Poſſeſſion of Power to Govern Arbitrarily implies an Authority from God to govern ſo.
<note place="margin">Vind. P. 86.</note> For if <hi>Actual Dominion and Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Power make a King,</hi> then Actual Arbitrary Power makes an Arbitrary King.</p>
            <p n="4">4. But the neceſſity of a thorough Settlement, before the full and entire Allegiance of the Subjects can become due to an Uſurper, is inconſiſtent with the Doctors Principles. For in his Account of the Relation between a King and a Subject he makes no mention of a thorough Settlement, nor ſuppoſes it in the leaſt, but on the contrary places the <hi>Relation in Actual Dominion and Sovereign Power, on the one hand, to make a King;
<note place="margin">Ib. P. 38.</note> and the Obligations to Subjection and Allegiance, on the other hand, to make a Subject.</hi> Why there ſhould not as well be actual Subjection and Alleglance to make a Subject, does not concern me now to enquire: it is enough to my preſent purpoſe, that Actual Dominion makes a King, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:95153:46"/>a Settled Diminion cannot be neceſſary to make one.
<note place="margin">Ib.</note> 
               <hi>If the Relation then of a King to his Subject be Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion and Government, does be continue a King,</hi> ſays the Doctor, <hi>when he has loſt his Dominion and Government?</hi> And does he continue an Uſurper, ſay I, who is actually poſſeſſed of Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Government; till he is tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly ſettled in it? If he does, how can Actual Dominion and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign Power make a King? How can it be true,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ibid.</hi>
               </note> that <hi>where Actual Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion and Government ceaſes, the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip is loſt, and the Obligation to Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection and Allegiance with it;</hi> if it be not likewiſe true, that where-ever there is Actual Dominion and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, there is Kingſhip, and the Obligations to Subjection and Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance with it? For <hi>the Actual Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of Power and Authority to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern, and Allegiance, or that Obedience and Subjection which is due to Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment are Relations,
<note place="margin">P. 37.</note> and do</hi> mutuò ſe ponere &amp; tollere.</p>
            <p>Thus all that he diſcourſes about this matter wholly excludes the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Notion of a thorough Settlement as neceſſary to make Allegiance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come due: The Subſtance of it all is, that there muſt of neceſſity be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſome Government, ſome actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Power in every Nation, whom the People are bound in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to obey, that therefore this is always from God, and that there can be no <hi>Interregnum,</hi> no time, wherein there is no viſible Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity ordained by God in any King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom: For if there were, God could not be ſaid to rule in ſuch a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom (of which more by and by.) Now how is this conſiſtent with the Notion of a thorough Settlement, which ſuppoſes that there may be an Interval of Time, more or leſs, when there is none with Authority from God to govern? In ſhort, if <hi>Actual Dominion</hi> make a King, what need can there be of a thorough Settlement to make Allegiance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come due to him? If there be a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity for a thorough Settlement, how can Actual Dominion make a King?</p>
            <p>I am perſwaded, the Diſtinction between Uſurpers, that are ſettled, and thoſe that are not ſettled, is, at leaſt, as <hi>unknown to Scripture,</hi> as the Diſtinction between Uſurpers and lawful Kings: And therefore, as the Doctor urges that if St. <hi>Paul,</hi>

            <p n="5">5. If it be neceſſary there ſhould be a thorough Settlement, before an Uſurper can have Gods Authority, and from the Death of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt, to the Reſtauration of the Royal Family, we had no ſettled Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, then by the Doctors Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples we had none of Gods Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity amonſt us.

In the Caſe of the Engliſh Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, during the Exile of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second; it is impoſſible for the Doctor to avoid the Force of his own Objection, though it really have no force in it againſt any bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, but himſelf. For God rules the World, when he permits all manner of Wickedneſs in it, and he rules Kingdoms, when he permits Kings, who have his Authority, to abuſe it to the worſt Purpoſes of Violence and Perſecution, and when he permits Subjects to rebel, and throw off the Yoke. He does not always govern Kingdoms by a viſible Authority, or by a Perſon authorized or ordained by himſelf to act as his Vicegerent: But it is yet to be proved, that God cannot govern Kingdoms, if he ſuffer Men to exerciſe all the outward Acts of Power and Sovereignty without any Right and Authority to do it; it remains to be proved, that when God ſuffers Subjects to caſt off that Authority, which he has appointed, to reject his Vicegerent, and to ſay, <hi>We will not have this Man to rule over us,</hi> they are then no longer under Gods Rule and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. And when this is proved, it will ſtill remain to be ſhewn, how by theſe Principles God could rule in theſe three Kingdoms, if there was no thorough Settlement, and conſequently no Perſon inveſted with Gods Authority, for ſo many Years together,</p>
